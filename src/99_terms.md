- **Addam:** The first Driver of Mythra 500 years ago. 
- **Architect:** Klaus, the mad scientist that split his original world in half, created this world. 
- **Blades:** Crystals summoned such living beings to help them fight, by either lending their power to their **Drivers**, or fighting themselves.
- **Cloud Sea:** The surface of **Alrest** is filled with a sea of clouds, beneath which is an ocean. 
- **Core Crystal:** Unactivated ones could be used to summon a Blade. When their Drivers die, the Blades returned to their Core Crystal, waiting for their next master. Upon resummoning, Blades' memory with their previous master will be totally wiped clean, for every return to the core crystal means a factory data reset. But when they see their masters, if their previous masters cared for them greatly, tears could still roll down their cheeks and they don't know why. 
- **Elysium:** The supposed heaven atop the World Tree where people lived in harmony and peace; a utopia. 
- **Fonsett Village:** The place where Rex was born and raised up. 
- **Titans:** the only creature that could brave the cloud sea by forever floating above. The giant ones, people built their cities on them. But titans also gets old, and when they do, they sink beneath the cloud sea, bringing the entire city with them. 
- **World Tree:** Supposedly holding **Elysium**, the heaven where people lived; but no, it's some factories where Klaus half-body were found, and nobody else there (except the non-living robots). The heavens were some deserts of dead plants and old-world remains, in dilapidated forms.
