# Off to Mor Ardain, Roc's Core Crystal Stolen

===

At Argentum, a Nopon knew him, "**Heeeyyyy!!! It's Rex!**"

"Rex come back alive?"

"Rex have **many** sidekicks now!"

Nia teased, "_Quite the little celebrity, aren't we?_"

"Welllll, you know. I've been trading here for a while. Anyway... I'll find us a ride to the Empire. You guys go on ahead to the inn."

"Sounds good. See you around, then!"

---

They were at the second floor of the Argentum Trade Guild, where the inn and restaurant located{{footnote: One cannot remember exactly if this is true, but correct me if one's wrong, leaving a comment at GitHub discussion. You can go directly to the page by clicking the GitHub icon on top right of the header, beside the 'print' symbol.}}, seated around the tables at the restaurant, listening to Rex. 

"**Right, so it looks like we're heading out tomorrow.** Everyone, make sure you're ready by then!"

Dromarch: "Understood."

Poppi: "**Affirmative!**"

---

They were seated around several small tables. On one, Pyra was having a sip of the tea, exclaimed, "The tea here is... lovely!"

Gramps, seated on the dining table, shared, "You can find quality goods here- from all around- Alrest. you like the place?"

"Yes. If there's time before we leave, I think I'll have another cup later."

At another table, Nia was stretching herself, "Mmmmmmph, feels so good to rest in a proper inn after a long voyage!"

Rex agreed, "**Yeah!** It's good to be on familiar shores again."

---

In the boys' dormitory, everyone was far asleep; even Gramps, curled inside Rex's helmet. "Mmmm... sniff sniff... Mmmmm.... Mmmmhmmm?"

Rex smelt something weird, tried to change position but found something pressing on his arm. He opened his eyes and immediately blushed, seeing Mythra in his hug, sleeping merrily. Urm... He looked down to see what's rubbing against his arms; and there you go, her breast... bouncy bouncy... "Erm..." What now?

![Mythra sleeping with Rex](images/144_mythra_wrong_room.jpg)

She felt something stiff, something not right, awakened her. "**Huh!**" This is bad... Very bad... Eyes to eyes they were looking straight at each other. 

She took a while to wake up, to realize what'd happened, shouted "**AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!**"

"**AAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!**" Both jumped out of bed. 

"**You! How did you-?! Wha...?! What are you doing in my bed?!**"

"**Wait, I...!!!**" He tried to calm her down, to reason about it. 

She wasn't listening, climbed down bed, and ran to the edge of the room, "**ARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!**" Get whatever's on the table, and threw it at him, "**GET OUT!!! INTERLOPER!!! MONSTER!!!**" 

"**W-wait a minute, would you- OWWW!!!**" She wasn't listening, and something hard knocked on his head. Tora on the other bed woke up and became a victim himself, already fainted. He quickly climbed back up, hand on the injured forehead, shouted as quickly as he could, "**You-You're the one in my room! The guys' room, see?!**"

That was quick. She stopped in her track, still holding onto a cup and a book to throw, feeling confused, "_Huh?_" She put it down, scanned the room. Tora, Dromarch, Rex, Gramps. Dang, speaking to herself, "_I can't believe it. I did it again..._ **I am SUCH an IDIOT!!!**" Covering her blushing face, she walked for the door as if nothing had happened. 

Dromarch wondered, "Hm... Is this what they call sleepwalking?"

But one thing was true. Before exiting, she looked at Rex, said, "You were staring..."

![You were staring](images/145_you_were_staring.jpg)

"**Huh?**" Staring at what? Red flushed up Rex's face. 

"**PERVERT!!!**" She walked out and slammed the door behind. 

All collapsed, he just recovered, "**WHA-WHA-WH-WH-WHAT?!!!**"

Gramps, dropped out of Rex's helmet, on Dromarch's bed, acknowledged, "She's **certainly** exposing an awful lot of skin."

Dromarch: "Pot, meet kettle.{{footnote: [Pot meet kettle](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/Pot%2c+meet+kettle!), is an idiom that says you're accusing someone for something you're equally guilty of.}}"

"Would you care- to **explain**- what that is supposed to mean, my good sir?"

"Have you looked in a _mirror_ recently?" Their eyes met, and whatever that meant...

---

Morning time, the people gathered around at the tables again. Gramps, Dromarch, Nia, Tora, and Poppi shared one table. Pyra seated alone at another. Rex just finished waking up, walking towards her gingerly, trying to scan whether he got the correct person, "_H-hi, Pyra..._"

![Rex assessing the situation](images/146_the_careful_rex.jpg)

She put her cup of tea down and turned around, "Ooh - good morning!"

"Listen, about earlier..."

"I'm... sorry... about Mythra. She gets **very** confused when she's just woken up..."

He nodded his head violently, "I... see..."

"It didn't get violent, did it?" 

He tried to cover up. "**No! I didn't do anything weird! Not a thing!**"

![Rex panicking](images/147_rex_panicking.jpg)

"No...? It was more Mythra... I was worrying about."

"Oh... right... hahah!" Revealed himself before she even finished speaking. As he calmed down, sat in front of her, "**I guess... she did throw a thing** or two."

She noticed the bump on his forehead. "Ugh! Oh, no! So that was where that came from." Pyra bent forward and gently touched his forehead, and he blushed again, eyes on the twin rabbit down there. "I'm sorry. Did it... hurt a lot?"

![Pyra bending forward](images/148_pyra_bending_forward.jpg)

In a panic, "N-no! Not at a-all! Really, I'm fine!"

She touched her own forehead, "Are you sure? Honestly.... my head is still a little painful." The others were secretly looking at their interaction, silently feeling nervous and excited for them. 

On the other table, 'pot' and 'kettle' were looking at those two interacting. Gramps exclaimed, "_Ahhh, to be young again..._"

"Indeed, indeed."

Gramps clamped together, eagerly spoke while daydreamt, "We need a little romance in our lives, too, eh?"

![Gramps need a little romance](images/149_gramps_need_romance.jpg)

"Actually, I'm... quite all right." Big eyes looking at small eyes. 

---

A Titan ship drifted the port of a metallic Castle. Mòrag and Brighid walked out of it, the central tower their destination. Inside the room, a red chair placed under the emblem of Mor Ardain, a young boy stood looking at the emblem and the chair, accompanied by his Blade. 

![Emperor Niall and his Blade, Aegaeon](images/150_niall_aegaeon.jpg)

"Aegaeon..."

"Yes." answered his Blade. A silver-dark-blue Blade had tubes wrapped around him, which light-blue fluid seemed to flow continuously in one direction and recycled into nothingness. Aegaeon turned around and walked away. Door opened and door closed, Aegaeon returned with Mòrag and Brighid. 

Mòrag bowed to the boy, "**I have returned from my assignment**, Your Majesty."

His eyes lit up seeing his sister returned safely, "Welcome back, Mòrag. You too, Brighid." Brighid also bowed to him in the Imperial posture, answered, 

"I'm honored."

"It is good to see you again, Brighid."

"You look well too, Aegaeon."

The boy, Emperor Niall{{footnote: Recall, during the first Blade awakening in the square in Torigoth, what the soldier called their Emperor?}}, turned back to Mòrag, asked, "So this Aegis... truly was the genuine article."

"Indeed."

"And the boy?"

"From his garments, he- appeared to be a young salvager."

"I would be most interested in meeting him." he said excitedly. 

"That can be arranged."

He looked at Aegaeon, whom step forward and handed Mòrag some documents, explained, "We have- received reports of an attack on a ship- headed for the Praetorium."

"A transport vessel?"

"Yes, carrying a cargo of Core Crystals."

"Core Crystals... Torna's work, then?"

"Most likely." replied Emperor Niall. "According to a lucky survivor, the culprit was a masked man."

"Jin... _It must have_ been him."

"This is the third time. From what I hear, Urayan vessels have also suffered significant damage."

Mòrag took a while to think what she should reply, "_My sincere apologies._ This is all my fault, Your Majesty. I let that Torna girl off lightly. I should have interrogated her more."

Emperor Niall shook his head, denied her burden, "You set the captive loose because you felt it **necessary**, did you not? **That**, is **enough** for me. Besides which, if this really is the doing of that **masked** man... I doubt he would have been _stopped_... even by an army 5,000 strong. **We have more pressing issues** to consider."

"**Such as?**"

"The Senate... have _independently_ resumed the excavation of Judicium."

"The pro-war faction... Senator Roderich."

"The loss of those Core Crystals... must have made them restless. Judicium- is a very- delicate- region. It would be unwise to provoke Uraya..."

"I understand your meaning. If the Senate make any unsavory moves, _we can take action._"

"I'm counting on you, _dear sister._"

---

They were walking towards where they are to depart when something caught Rex's eyes, "This light... What is it?" He took out something from his pocket and held it up. "Roc's Core Crystal?!" It had regained resonating ability, lit up again. "It was like a stone. What happened?!"

Nia: "Don't you remember, Rex? Vandham told you. Core Crystals don't 'die'. They always regenerate after a while."

"Regenerate?"

"Ready to be reawakened by a new Driver."

"So... if I resonated with it now..."

Dromarch answered, "Then a new Roc would be born into this world."

"A new- Roc... Vandham's Blade..." He was looking at it. Should he? What sad memories will it remind them, keeping someone whom lost all memories of their loved ones in the group? 

Tora: "What do?"

"I'm not sure. Taking Vandham's old partner... I-It just doesn't feel right."

Nia: "Y-eah, but may-be he would have wanted you to do it. Just do whatever."

"Right..."

Behind the stairs some distance from where they gathered, a boy with dark skin, wearing like some ancient Indian tribes, with long hair like lion manes, looked at them. 

Nia suggested, "Probably time we headed for the ship, right?"

"**Oh - yeah!**"

"I'll go ahead and register us for boarding."

Pyra questioned, "Nia, do we really need to rush?"

"**Sure**, we could take our time. **And** miss out on the good seats!" And she already ran away, eyes looking backwards. Just as she turned, some shadow was dashing at her, and she jumped, barely dodged it, "Oops."

The kid dashed quickly through Rex and knocked him on his pelvis, "**Owww...**" His hands quickly touched where he's hit; Pyra and the others looked the kid running off, disappearing towards the main building. "What was that kid's problem?"

Then Pyra noticed, "**Rex! Your bag!**"

"Huh?" He looked to where he'd put his bag, on the pelvis. Gone. "No... **No! NOOO!!!**"

Nia returned, asked, "What've you lost now?"

"**Roc's Core Crystal! It's not here!**"

"**You mean that little blighter...?!**"

Dromarch snapped, "**After him! At once!**"

Rex: "**TITAN'S FOOT!!!**" All dashed after him. 

---

Nowhere to be seen. Nia asked, "That little thief looked pretty young, right?"

"**Yeah!** And those ears. Gormotti for sure."

"So let's see..." She scanned the various ports for any sign. "**There! That's the brat!**" He was standing on one of the port. They ran after him. Seeing they were coming, he quickly dashed for the water, pushing against some older guy in his way, 

"**WHOA!** Ugh! **"What d'you think you're doing?!**" The guy dropped to the floor and shouted. The kid had boarded a departing ship at the last moment. 

Nia couldn't believe what happened, "Why that **little...! He stole the whole ship!**"

Pyra: "**What now?!**"

Rex decided, "**Let's go! Are there any other...**" They looked around for free ship, eyed one. "**There's one! Garram!**"

The guy charging for the port which asked Rex for money for docking Gramps during the first chapter turned around and felt surprised, "**Hey, Rex. What's the big hurry?**"

"**Lend me your boat!**" He went straight to the subject. 

"What? I mean, **sure**, but why?"

"There was a pickpocket! Took our Core Crystal! **Over there!**" 

"Over there?"

The ship wasn't yet lost at the horizon, and the guy the kid knocked over was at the edge of the port watching his ship departed. He shouted, "**HOOOOLLLDDDD IT! BRING THAT SHIP BACK HERE!!!**"

"**Why, that's Pittman's ship! Your thief's on board THAT thing?**"

"**PLEEEEEEEAAAAAASSSEEE!!!**"

"All right, then! **The key's in the slot, so you can take her right out!**"

"**Thanks! I'll bring her back as soon as I can.**"

"**Nooooo worries! Go get 'em, Rex!**" The ship therefore set out after the thief's. 

---

The ship entered and park at a dock. They were looking around to find, until Tora eyed it, "**Thaaaaat the ship!**"

Rex recognized, "Yeah, no doubt about it. This is where he got off."

Dromarch hypothesized, "He may still- be- somewhere- nearby."

Nia suggested, "Right. Then let's ask around and see what we can find!"

Rex agreed, "**Good plan!**"

---

Can't escape. They found the place out alone in the plains by the side of the Titan, one side facing the Cloud Sea. Nia: "If we're on the right track, he should be around here, yeah?"

"Thief using **Umon's workshop** as hideout... I **never dream** of such a thing!" Tora felt angry about it.{{footnote: Oops. How to explain about the ship they borrowed?}}

Looking behind the door, they saw the few kids gathered within, in a circle. No sign of Umon, but Rex recognized, "That's him. Let's surround them- so he can't run."

Nia: "Gotcha." The rest nodded. 

Hearing footsteps, the kid turned around, and all get into defensive stance, "Ahh! You lot!"

![The kids](images/152_the_kids.jpg)

Rex: "**Kid!** You sure led us on a merry chase. **You've wasted a lot of our time**, you know."

"Dammit!"

"**Look at you. You're only kids.** Why don't you just give back what you took? We'd rather not hurt you or anything."

"You're basically a kid yourself!"

"**Oi! I'll have you know,** I work for a living. Right, hand it over."

"**N-NO! You're not having it!**" And he blew a whistle, called some bird monsters as reinforcements. "The Core Crystal is ours now! If you want it so bad, you'll have to **take it by force!**"

"**Well, nothing for it**, I guess. All right, let's go!" And the battle begun. 

---

Holding Roc's Core Crystal in his hand, Rex announced, "Well, we took it by force. **Just like you wanted us to.**"

"Ugh!" The other kids felt scared too. 

Rex exclaimed, "Titan's foot, **you're all barely** 10 years old. **Why are you stealing from people?**"

"Ugh..."

Nia urged, "Look, keeping your traps **shut won't help anyone.**"

"My lady, **be a little** more gentle..."

"Why? They're only petty thieves."

"**Be that** as it may, they are _still_- children..."

Rex urged, "Look, I'm sure there's a reason you're doing all this. Are you just- that hard up?"

One of the kids (not the one doing the stealing) snapped back, "**What do you take us for?! We're not some poor beggars!**"

"**OK!** So it's not money you're after..." Oopsie. 

Nia urged once more, "**Then what the hell is it they want?**"

Tora too: "You should just **tell everything**. Rex-Rex not hurt you."

"Ugh..."

"C'mon."

The stealing kid, their leader, started, seeing they won't leave them alone, "**We want revenge.**"

"Revenge?"

"We're gonna... **avenge** our village!"

"You don't mean... You were planning to awaken this Blade and use it? Why don't you tell us the whole story? We might be able to help."

---

"Bandits attacked your village?" Pyra concluded. 

"It was just a small, peaceful village. _But the bad men... Just because we had water, they..._"

Nia prompted for more, "Did anyone survive? Don't tell me... you're the only ones?" They put their head down, said nothing. 

"What's your name?" asked Rex of their leader. 

"Me? Why d'you wanna know?" a nobody like me? 

"Please, kid."

"It's Rhys. From Cordell Village."

"Cordell Village... Can't say I've heard of it." said her whom was born here. 

"It's just a tiny village on the outskirts of Gormott. Not many people know it."

Rex: "OK, Rhys. I get why you did this. But still, it's not right to steal from people. Besides which, awakening a Blade is dangerous. Do you know what happens if it fails?"

"**You never now until you try! Long as one of us manages it, that's all that matters!**"

Gramps climbed out of the helmet and expressed, "Sounds like you- really- were- desperate, my boy. **I assume you know the whereabouts** of these bandits?"

"There's a big cave over on Twin Trunks Hill. They use it as a hideout."

A kid sudden came in, ignored the group, and shouted full of worries, "**Ohhhh, Rhys! It's awful! Those scum are gonna-!**" She paused for a while, realized, "Huh? Who are they?"

Rhys urged, "Don't worry about them. **What's the matter?**"

"R-right, OK... **The bandits are planning to attack Torigoth!**"

"Are you sure?" Torigoth, a big city with most, if not all, the armies on Gormott? 

"**Yeah! We overheard one of their men talking** about it in the city just now."

"And it was definitely one of them?" Rhys wanted to confirm. 

"It looked like they were scouting the place out. **They were saying with the consul gone, now's the perfect chance to take advantage.**"

Dromarch: "A shrewd observation... This would **indeed** be the perfect time to mount an **attack**."

Nia: "Are you trying to tell me that idiot consul was actually good for something?"

Tora dropped his head, "So... this... all **our** fault?"

Rex can't deny, "Well... Yeah, **I guess** we might have been the trigger."

Pyra urged strongly, "We can't sit by and let this happen."

"A-greed! **Right, you lot! You can leave those nasty bandits to us.**"

Rhys was surprised, "Wh-what?"

"I swear. We'll avenge your village."

"But..."

Rex took steps forward and handed out his hand to Rhys, said, "Don't worry." The kid strongly took his hand and shook. Agreement formed. 

---

Outside the hut. Rex introduced himself, "By the way, **name's Rex**. Rhys, take the others and go warn the city guard."

"Warn them... about the bandits?"

"Nah, they probably wouldn't believe you if you said bandits were coming. So **tell them... about us instead.** Tell them the guys who destroyed the water tower... are hiding out... at Twin Trunks Hill."

"If you say so... but why?"

"Don't worry, you'll see. We're counting on you, **OK?**"

"OK."

---

An ether miasma was blocking their way. "Whaaaat the..."

Dromarch: "Well, this is **quite** the **unhelpful** obstruction."

Nia was thinking for a while, recognized, "Hey, isn't this the same as the thing we saw in the blowhole? With Vandham?"

Gramps agreed, "**Indeed**, it seems to be the same phenomenon."

"In that case..." Pyra looked at Rex. 

He agreed, "Yeah. We just need a **little help** from Roc!" Taking out Roc's Core Crystal, Rex convinced himself, "**Vandham, mate**... Hope this is OK."

"Rex..." Pyra wondered what he'd been shouldering all alone. He'd to get through this himself. 

---

Roc came online once again. Nia exclaimed, "**All right!**"

Pyra was excited too, "**You really did it!**"

Rex: "Roc..." Such reminder. 

"So, _you- are- my-_ new Driver. Bit of a **scrawny** one, if you ask me, but ahhhh well. It's good to meet you."

"Ummmm..." Rex don't know yet how to voice to his mentor's partner. 

Nia noticed, "_He talks kind of like_ Vandham, huh."

"**Vandham**? Who is that?"

"_Oh, right._ You wouldn't remember, since you've been reawakened now. He was your old Driver."

"My old Driver?" he looked to Rex for a while, hypothesized, "**Ah**, so my- core- was passed down to you."

Nia suggested another situation, "We coulda... stolen it."

"**I didn't sense** any **guilt** in your words."

Gramps: "Mmmm, you're a perceptive one, all right. Yes, you take after your old master in moooore ways than one."

Rex got to the point first, since time was tight, "Listen, Roc. We need your help. Reckon you could... clear the way for us?"

He turned around to see, "**This stuff?** Of course. Nothing simpler."

---

Rex exclaimed, after he cleared it, "**Wow!** That hardly took **any** time at all!"

"Hmph. I did say it was a simple task."

"Thanks a bunch, Roc!"

Roc looked at him for quite an elongated moment, and Rex asked, "Roc?"

"Tell me something. Myyyyy previous Driver..."

"You mean Vandham?"

"Yes, this... Vandham. _What- kind-_ of a man- was he?"

Rex dropped his head in reminiscence, gathering his thoughts together for a moment, before starting to speak, "He was **incredibly** strong. He looked kind of **scary**, but he was kind, too..." And it took him some courage to muster the next words, "_And he saved my life._ It's thanks to Vandham... that we're all standing here now."

"I see... Then, I think I'd better protect you all, too."

"Huh?"

"To **carry on** my Driver's will... assss best I can... **That's** the path I feel **best befits** a Blade."

"Oh, Roc..." That was heartwarming! 

---

Rex was hiding behind some rocks looking at the bandits inside the flame-lit cavern. Boxes of treasures were piled around all the sides, while people rested around a campfire in the middle.{{footnote: Lucky they don't get carbon monoxide poisoning, setting up flames in non-moving air.}}

Nia asked, "So what's the plan? Looks like there's quite a few of 'em, **and** they have Blades too."

Rex: "_No time for complicated plans._ Don't worry, **they'll be no match** for us!"

"I knew _you'd say that._ But hey, I'm **not** saying you're wrong!"

"Just- remember, we're not here to kill anyone, so mind you don't go overboard."

Tora don't understand the conflicting message, "Was Rex-Rex not going to avenge village?"

"There's more than one way to do that, right?"

Nia: "Well, if you say so..."

Pyra: "Understood."

Rex made the call, "Right. **Let's go!**" Immediately, they entered the room with Rex shouting for attention, like a police, "**All of you, put down your weapons! You're NOT going to harm that city!**"

The groups gathered in a line facing the group, one of them shouting back, "**Who the hell are you punks? We ain't got time for a bunch of kids!**"

One of the buff guy warned, "**Hold it! They're Drivers and Blades!** Now I get it... The **city** hired you, huh?!"

"**What d'you think?**" Not that we're going to tell you. 

"_Bah!_ How'd you find out about... Whatever. **HEY, LADS! LET'S SLAUGHTER THESE BRATS!!! We'll make an example of 'em!**" 

"**YEAAAAHHHH!!!**" The energetic bandits shouted in unison. And the battle began.

---

Outside the cavern, all the soldiers fallen had been dragged outside. 

"Whew! Well, we managed to beat them, all right. But what now?" asked Nia. 

Rex turned to the road that they were passing through just now entering the valley. Soldiers were seen coming to the location, trekking slowly, fully armored. Gramps: "Ah, right on time."

"Oh I get it. Thaaat's why you asked the kids to call them here."

Rex: "It isn't **us** they need to answer to,... right?"

Dromarch agreed, "Leaving them to the authorities... A wise decision."

Pyra suggested, "I suppose- we should probably leave, then. It's not a good idea to be here when the military arrives. **Let's go!**"

Rex agreed, "**Yeah, let's move!**" And he lead the way to someplace safer. 

---

At the Argentum port, the kids followed Rex to meet Garram and Pittman, explained the situation to them, and he pleaded, "So you see, considering the situation, could you let them off the hook?"

Garram: "Hmmm. I'd hate to deny a request from you, Rex, and I can see these kids've had a hard time. What d'you think?" He looked to Pittman. 

"**Welllll... I suppose I did get my ship back**, safe and sound."

Rex made a suggestion, "Hey, how about this? Make them work for the Guild, and get them to work off what they owe **that way!**"

"Wha-?" One of the kids was surprised. 

Garram: "**These brats?**" You sure you're not inviting them to steal again? "Are you saying, we should make **salvagers** of them?"

Rex agreed, "I think they show a lot of promise! They've got pretty quick fingers -- right?" He nudged to the kids, not waiting them reply, turned back to Garram, "Come on, you know it makes sense. They're poor little **orphans** with **nowhere to go! Are you really** just gonna... turn them away?"

"You sure know how to twist a guy's arm... All right, I'll do it! I'll sort out the details with Pupunin. But... it's just **bed and board** for now, got that? If you want paying, **you prove yourselves first!**"

Rex turned to Rhys, "**You hear that? I hope you don't mind...**"

"Wow..."He wiped off some tears of gratitude. 

"**Right then! Work hard, you rascals!**"

> **Translator's note on environment:** The Mor Ardain Titan is entirely covered with factory, with steam and smoke emitting from tall chimneys. The Titan's very old, its skin could no longer support lush vegetation plantation. Still, it stands. Most of the rusty buildings built there during their Industrial Revolution were not necessarily on land, but could be carved out into cliff walls. Industrial machinery lined every single road on the Titan, transporting cargoes and whatnots to and from factories. This, is the **Empire of Mor Ardain.**
