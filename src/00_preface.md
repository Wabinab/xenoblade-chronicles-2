# Preface

When one was writing the story, one'd just finished _The Situation and the Story_ by Vivian Gornick, so one aspires to write the story in a more different way than one used to write in the past on XC3 and XC Future Redeemed. That's including some personal feelings the characters feel, by making it look more like a memoir. Sure, it perhaps worked, but one don't know; even if that's putting oneself in the shoes of the characters, it's perhaps _not exactly_ how the character feels, and all one could do is making the best guess. One had the doubt of whether to do that or not. Would it reveal something too open that one should write more secretively for the reader to guess themselves? Or perhaps, should the reader be left to their own device in interpreting the feelings of the characters? 

When we reached the [end of Chapter 6](./23_omega_fetter.md), we were by that time started to read _A Swim in the Pond in the Rain_ by George Saunders. Initially, one read the book for another purpose: to write a book on one's own memoir; but when one realized the book is on fiction story, one assumed prematurely that most won't apply, but one don't know yet. As of writing this paragraph, one'd just finished the 2nd story, "The Singers", and hadn't even read author's Afterthought yet. But what he wrote at the end of the "Thoughts on 'The Singers'" changed one's mind yet again on how one should write this story. So perhaps, on the part that's most stressful, if you read on, you'll find one offers an extensive description to the actions and the description, in addition to the limited pictures of the scenery one added, of what the characters offered. Sure, with limited vocabulary from one's side, one could only offer an _estimate_ of how they did. Some of it one even had to translate from Chinese (because one could explain them in such language but not in others), and the translation might not be accurate, but nonetheless, one tried as best as one could. That's when one said, one'll let the reader interpret what the character feel for themselves. Yet, even at this point, one isn't sure if one wants to abandon the previous notion of how one write the story up until now, so perhaps one'll still retain some, or quite a lot, of the method of writing the characters from a first person perspective in the rest of the story; but when things gets rough, and when one can't really put one's shoes in the character, you, reader, will be the ones that'll determine how they would feel, or how they _should_ feel, in your mind. One'll leave it to you.

### Ways to Read

If you see- words- in- dash-, it means there are a short pause in between words. If you see... dots..., it means a long pause in between speech. If you see **bold characters**, it means shouting out. **BOLD AND CAPITALS** means shouting to the largest amplitude your throat can take you. _Italics_ means soft, unless otherwise specified, which means dreams/recalling from the memory. 

> Things in quotes like this are either long memories that can't be compressed in a single _italics_, or if otherwise stated, some note one added. 

The others should be clear per se.
