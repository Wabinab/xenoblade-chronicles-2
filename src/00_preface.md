### Ways to Read

If you see- words- in- dash-, it means there are a short pause in between words. If you see... dots..., it means a long pause in between speech. If you see **bold characters**, it means shouting out. **BOLD AND CAPITALS** means shouting to the largest amplitude your throat can take you. _Italics_ means soft, unless otherwise specified, which means dreams/recalling from the memory. 

> Things in quotes like this are either long memories that can't be compressed in a single _italics_, or if otherwise stated, some note one added. 

The others should be clear per se.
