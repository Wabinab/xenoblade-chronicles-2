# Vandham of Uraya

===

Walking out of the tunnel, the interior was now lit bright. Nia noted, "There's some kinda _dim light..._"

Gramps: "If I remember, the Urayan Titan... has a translucent hide. I bet that'll be the light filtering through."

Rex: "So... the Titan must be above the clouds now?"

"I dare say!"

Pyra suggested, "If we can make it to the source of the light, maybe we'll find a way out of here."

"Hold it!" A stranger's voice sounded. They looked up and saw the source of the voice. He jumped and landed in front of the group. His blade, a bird standing on two legs with pouch on its breast, trailed behind. And some other friends following him. "Looks like a bunch of mushes I ain't seen yet. You gotta have pretty **damn bad luck**, ending up in a Titan's guts like this. Huh? That Blade... An emerald **Core Crystal!**"

![Vandham too dark to see clearly](images/081_vandham_in_the_dark.jpg)

Rex was triggered. Whoever said that so far hadn't brought them good news. 

"**BWAHAHAHAHAHAH!** So, the rumors are true!"

"Huh? What rumors?" wondered Rex. 

"The tale that every Driver worth his _salt knows_. The legendary **Aegis**. Folks been saying she just woke up from a 500-year nap. Wouldn't have thought... she'd show up with a pencil-neck **shrimp like you for a Driver, though.**" He started laughing at Rex's body size. 

"**You think I don't have what it takes?**" that provoked him. 

"**Nah**, I mean... Maybe you could handle a _normal_ Blade. **But a greenhorn like YOU, with a beaut like HER?** _Don't kid yourself._ C'mon boy. **Hand her over to a grown-up.**"

"This crap is getting old. Leave her alone!" They started ready for battle. 

"Y'got heart, kid. _I like that._ Yew, Zuo, you take care of the others. _I wanna squash the kid._"

"Heheh. Leave it to us, boss."

![Yew](images/082_yew.jpg)

"We'll take **real** good care of 'em." And the battle begins. 

![Zuo](images/083_zuo.jpg)

---

"What's the matter? Are you the Aegis or aren't ya?!" Pyra was having difficulty transferring her power to Rex. The buff guy was slamming his dual scythe at Rex as he complaint, knocking Rex off easily as he had difficulty shielding himself. Before one attack he don't have enough time to react, Pyra got in front of him and blocked it for him. 

As Pyra was blocking, she had doubts within, thinking, "_Huh? Something feels... different. This man, he's..._" No time to think more, he knocked her off. 

"That all ya got, mate? Pathetic."

Rex drew more power at being provoked, "**We'll show you! We'll show you what me and Pyra are made of!**" Continuously, he threw fireballs at the guy, which he adeptly dodged. "He dodged?"

"Course I did, kid. _Any slower, you'd bore me to death._"

"How about **THIS, THEN?**"

"Hmph." More serious, but he still dodged the multiple fireballs incoming. Those that he cannot, he sliced them aside. 

Meanwhile, Pyra was shouting for help, "**REX, WAIT!!! I can't supply power this fast!**" He wasn't listening, and the guy had backed up with his back sticking to the rocks already. Seeing this is victory, he pushed forward, 

"**Nowhere left to run! Eat this!**" He was summoning Burning Sword when the guy's eyes was on the exhausted Pyra, which Rex hadn't yet realized. But it didn't worked; the sword sheathed itself halfway. "Huh?"

He was trying to check what's happening when the guy took the chance, "Playtime's over. Take this!" And he came real fast at Rex; he was defenseless. 

"**AHHHHH!!!**"

"**Hah! If you're a Driver, you're a new one for sure.** Drivers, see. We borrow our Blades' energy... channel it into our weapons... And let rip with an Art!" The scythe is on his neck. He closed his eyes to prepare for the imminent death that did not come. He then slowly opened his eyes as he listened to the guy speaking. As the guy sheathed his weapon, he continued his lecturing, "**But you gotta be careful** -- there's a **limit** to it. If you go in all bull-headed like that, kid, even that Aegis of yours, is gonna run out of energy before long."

![Pyra exhausted](images/084_pyra_exhausted.jpg)

He turned and saw Pyra catching her breathe on the ground. Yet, he was so confused, "W-what???"

On the other battlefield, Yew and Zuo sheathed their weapons. All were confused. 

"Huh? Uh?" Nia turned and looked around her to see what just happened. 

"**The name's Vandham.**" the buff guy introduced himself, knocked his chest hard. "I run a little firm, out of the nearby village."

"A... 'firm'?" wondered Rex. 

He invited, "**Come on! I'll treat you to some** grub, as thanks for letting me take a whack, at the legendary Aegis! **BWAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!**" 

Pyra, meanwhile, had caught her breathe and stood again beside Rex. And she explained to him, "Just then... I realized- while we were fighting, I sensed from the very start, that... he didn't mean us any real harm." 

They were already leaving, assuming the group followed behind slowly. Rex commented, "_Hmm, he sure is a strange old goat, that one..._"

---

As they were walking towards the village, Vandham listened to their story, exclaimed, "Helluva story! So you headed to the World Tree to reach Elysium, but got swallowed up whole **instead**? You got some crazy luck."

Rex: "So, er, what were you doing back there, then?"

"Y'know, this Titan... It ain't too fussy about what it eats. I went down there to see if anything we might need in the village, washed up. **But mostly I only found, YOUR sorry mushes.**"

"Yeah, sorry about that..."

"**Here we are.** Welcome to Garfont. Ain't much but it's home."

![Garfont Village](images/085_garfont_village.jpg)

Several people doing push ups with instructor sitting there overlooking them. Nopon and kids playing together at other places. 

Pyra noticed, "The village has... a lot of children."

Tora: "Lots of Drivers and Blades here too!"

Vandham explained, "We're in the business... of dispatching **Drivers** and Blades... **all across** the world. Most of the kids are war orphans. Took 'em in while on the job."

Dromarch rephrased, "So you're saying, that you, take them under your wing."

Yew answered for him, "Just till they're able to make it by themselves."

Zuo added, "Some of 'em, **might grow up to be Drivers**, like ourselves. **But then others might become** tailors."

Vandham: "Doesn't matter what they wanna do with their lives. We leave it up to them to decide."

Yew: "Aye. Us 'Justice Busters' just wanna help."

Nia commented, "Good eggs, huh?"

Vandham wasn't angry with the labeling, "You said it. I've been called worse. Come one. Let's eat! All this egg-talk is making me hungry." And he lead the way. Rex stayed behind as others moved on, wasn't sure what he's feeling content at. 

---

![Eating](images/086_eating.jpg)

As the group was scarfing up whatever presented to them at the canteen, sitting at 2 tables. One table was Nia, Dromarch, Poppi, and Tora.{{footnote: Yew and Zuo had other things to do in the village.}} At the other table with Vandham, his bird blade, Gramps, Rex, and Pyra, Pyra said, "I'm going to get some water. Vandham?"

"Cheers, love! Gimme a beer!" He finished swallowing before replied. 

"**Beer? Coming right up!**" She replied cheerfully before leaving the table. 

Looking at Rex touching nothing, eyes on emptiness, he asked, "**What's up?** The grub don't suit you?"

"So... do you fight in wars too, Vandham?"

"You got a problem with mercenaries?"

"Are you **trying to get us to join up?**"

"**Hah! Shrimps like you?** We're not THAT desperate. **Relax!**"

"OK. Good to know."

"Hmmm... Rex, you're a salvager, ain't ya?"

"Yeah."

"You musta fished out your share... _of military supplies, right?_ You fine with that?"

"Naaaahhh. **I don't wanna get involved with it.**"

"**It's all the same.** Compasses, **valves for ether stoves... Armies need** all these things. **The bread you're eating?** It's made from ruska flour. Supplied by the Ardainian government. **This world's full of war.** Don't matter if you're a soldier or not. As long as you're **alive**... you're in the war, **some way or another. Don't you think?**"

He felt his chest heavier and heavier, all the stuffs he salvaged up being used to push forward wars, all the things he eat stained with the blood of those winning it over, the pressure of life crushing like a big rock that cannot be removed from his chest; the sadder and sadder, more desolate he felt. "_Um, I..._"

"_Life can be cruel. Crueler than you know. That's why I set up this little band, so I could **protect**, the people I care about._" His words were hopefully enlightening to him. "Rex. _You're the Driver of the Aegis. The whole world's gonna try and **scalp you**, you realize that?_ How ya gonna live, _when you got everyone... **gunning** for ya? It'd be easy to run. All you'd need to do is ditch that girl._"

![Pyra preparing drinks for them](images/087_pyra_preparing_drinks.jpg)

She was still preparing the water and beer there behind the counter as they looked. 

"Ugh!" But he could not, not after all the adventure and friendship and dependency on each other and promises he'd made. He'd bring her to Elysium, and she'd made him a non-nobody. Or, perhaps, more... she's now his de facto partner. And he enjoyed the various ups and downs with her he went through more than the repetitive and boring life with Gramps before this, thinking back at whoever was waiting for him at Fonsett Village all day long as self-motivation. Her appearing makes his world never the same anymore. 

Vandham let him think for himself; he could only help so much. He had to make his own decision. "_Hmmm..._" Then he abruptly stood up{{footnote: Even before his beer had came back.}}, shouted, "**C'mon! Gotta get ready!**"

"Wh-where are we going?"

"Just **follow me, kid!**" And he and his blade walked off. Rex stood up, watched by Dromarch, while his other companions were still scarfing down whatever's on the table. 

---

"We just got a job to go check out some kinda crazy energy effect. Somewhere up around the blowhole. Whaddya say? Fancy bein' a mercenary for a day?" The group had gathered just outside the village. 

Rex: "Ummmmmm, OK? But, I mean, we don't work for free..."

"Don't worry, kid, you'll get paid." Together they head for their destination. 

---

There was a giant wind swirling around a ball in the distance. "Ahhh..." They wondered what was that...

![Ether Miasma](images/089_ether_miasma.jpg)

Vandham introduced it, "An ether miasma. Take it this is ya- first one."

"Ether miasma?" Rex wanted to know more. 

"It's a load of poisonous waste products, spewed from the Titan's **guts**. Y'know, when you get gassy? Kinda like that."

Nia: "_Erm, is there a way_ through this thing? I can't see any way round it."

"Hey, no fear. Roc, mate! You're up!" Summoned his Blade, the bird blade, Roc, flew into the air and slashed some air fang at the ether miasma, dissipating it. 

Rex noted, "Miasma's died down!"

"**Heheheheh! Yup, nothing to it. Let's roll!**" And they continued their journey. 

---

They exit the entrance of the tunnel and saw "An Ardun... Just what we need. Rex, any good with that anchor?"

![Ardun and the new environment](images/090_ardun.jpg)

He looked at his anchor a moment, assertively answered, "**Yeah**, I get by!"

"Hand that here." He agreed, detached it and gave it to Vandham. "Now watch." He point the anchor at the Ardun's leg; it swirled around, and he pulled, toppling the Ardun. 

"**Awesome!** I never thought of using it that way!" Rex was impressed. 

"The trick is to pull it taut at just the right moment." He then threw it back to Rex, instructed as the Ardun turned his attention to them, "Now you try!"

---

After the battle, Vandham praised, "You got it after seeing it once. Not bad, kid."

"Heheheh!" Scratching his head as he blushed a little at the praise. 

"**Listen up**, kid. Drivers, use Arts. But that doesn't just mean _using the powers your Blade gives you._ There are Arts that use your own strength, _or take advantage of your enemy's._ **There are all sorts. A Driver's** job... _is to be smart with his Arts, and **protect** his Blade._"

"Protect my Blade?" Rex hadn't yet understood. If they could fight better than him, why do they need his protection? Plus, like Dughall said, if Blades can regenerate, isn't it _logical_ to use them as meat shield?

"_Yeah._ It's a two-way thing, kid. **You gotta be aware of the power** comin' out of her. _Don't waste it_, channel it through your Arts, and protect her. _If you can do that, then you're a true Driver, kid._"

"'A true Driver'? _I don't know. Am I ready?_" Put him deep in thoughts, questioning himself. 

"'Course you are. That thing from before? Took me **five years** to learn that."

"Five years?!" So surprising. 

"_Yeah. But you saw it once, and then you aced it like it was **nothin'**._ And, you got Nia and Tora in tow. _Those guys are pretty handy._ Kid, _you got a bright future._"

Aww, so sweet that "I think I'm gonna spew," exclaimed Nia.

Tora: "Biggipon has scary face, but he very nice!"

"**BWAHAHAHAHAHAH!!! Sussed me out, furrypon!**"

---

They reached their destination and found a small Titan lying there, dying. 

![Dying Titan](images/091_dying_titan.jpg)

"Like I thought..."

"**A Titan?!**" exclaimed Rex. "**So that weird power effect** they clocked... **Maybe this is the cause?**"

"Yeah, sure looks like it." Vandham agreed. 

Gramps added, "I'll hazard it wasn't death by old age, either. Might have been an accident... On the other hand, it might have been attacked..."

As he finished, the ground shook. The group looked to its source. A giant arachnid with red coral-like veins growing out of its head, stampeding its pillar-like feet as it walked out to face the group. And there was a humanoid bull-shaped face muscular Blade beside the Arachno.{{footnote: The Driver of the Blade is the arachno. Don't ask me why a monster can wield a Blade. Scary thoughts. They're so strong themselves and they can gain more power from their Blades???}}

Vandham noted, "Hey, look! Seems like this Titan dying off has stirred up something else!"

---

After felling the arachno and the Blade, the Blade returned to its Core Crystal; but unlike the Core Crystal that shone crystal blue, this one is dark, emitting no light. Rex noted: "The Blade returned to its core..."

Pyra: "So that monster was in- resonance with the Blade..."

Tora felt jealous, "Tora cannot resonate, _stinky monster **can** resonate._ **Not fair!**"

"But... Masterpon have Poppi!"

"_Ohhh, Poppi..._" So sweet to embrace. 

Vandham brought their attention back to the Core Crystal, "_If a Blade loses its Driver, it winds up like this._"

Rex: "So, is it, like, dead?"

"Nah! The crystal'll start glowing again after a bit of time. Then a new Driver can resonate with it. But..."

"There's a but?"

"_Its memory will be totally zapped._ It'll be **reborn**, as a new Blade. **Won't remember** a thing."

"Yeah? That's pretty rough... To have all your past wiped out like that..."

She who lived for so long without her memories wiped out had something to say, "But memories can be... painful as well. They can be a terrible burden. And... a Blade- can live forever, as long as the crystal exists. It's just as well. Eternity is a loooong time to collect bad memories."

![Beautiful background](images/092_the_background.jpg)

"Pyra..." Is this what she had been holding to herself for so long, didn't had anyone to share? And if the event hadn't acted as a trigger, she would continue withholding it all to herself? 

"_I'm sorry._ I was just thinking, sometimes being able to forget, is a... blessing."

Vandham urged, turned their attention to the task at hand, "**C'mon! Leeeet's get finished up here!**" He walked up to the Titan alone while the others looked. Blue flames and motes had been evaporating off the Titan, just like with Gramps not so long ago before he metamorphosed and returned to his larval state. 

![Titan Dying](images/093_evaporating_titan.jpg)

Coming back, he took out a glimmering light blue cubic Core Crystal. Rex: "That's..."

Tora: "**A Core Crystal!**"

"**What?!!**" Rex was surprised. But how? 

Vandham explained, "Well that's where they come from. _Out of Titans._ This one's brand new and ready to resonate. _Like a big steak, right before you take that first **bite**._ It'll probably end up **buddying** up, with a **bunch** of Drivers. _Every time the Driver dies_, it'll forget everything, and return to its core. **Eventually, it'll resonate with a new** Driver. Drivers dyin', **Titans dyin'**... _The Blade, just keeps on livin' through it all..._ It's a never-ending cycle. An eternal history. _As mortals,_ we'll **never** be able to understand."

"It's incredible!" 

Pyra can felt the thud as she can understood her previous driver long gone, still in her memories. But Rex didn't noticed; nor can he, about 12, can yet relate to. She walked to the Titan still blindingly evaporating herself, put both her hands by her heart, closed her eyes, and prayed. May farewell be with you, Titan; may your road in the next resurrection be peaceful. 

![Titan Dying](images/094_titans_dying.jpg)

![Pyra praying for the Titan](images/095_pyra_praying.jpg)

> Meanwhile, in Rex's head, he wondered, "_But... Pyra already had a body when we found her... Could her old Driver still be alive somewhere?... Perhaps..._"

---

The group rested back at the camp after their hard work. Tora punching Poppi palm as she held them out, Nia combing Dromarch's fur, Vandham sat with his blade watching Pyra and Rex. 

"Owowowowowo... ah..." Both were holding a cotton ball on their hands, helping each other cleaning their wounds. 

Pyra: "**Hey**, hold still. I thought you were a **tough** salvager, Rex!"

"Gimme a break. Pain is pain, isn't it? How about you? Are you hurt?"

"Don't worry, it's just a scra-..." He touched her injured elbow with the cotton ball softly, "**AAARRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!! That was on purpose! You were hurting me on purpose, weren't you? Well?**"

He shook his heads and hands vibrantly to deny. "**I wasn't, honest! I was just rubbing the lotion in...**"

She backed away, cried, "**Rex! You rubbed it too hard! It hurts, see!**"

And she 'revenged' with the 'same' force back at his wounds, "**ARGGGHHHH!!!**"

Vandham, whom had been watching them for long, started to walk up to them without them noticing. "**Hey, you two!**" It shocked their teasing attention back to him as they sat straight, and Vandham instructed, "Gimme a look at that."

He eyed their wounds left and right, noticed they were matching locations. He was so confused, commented as he continued eyeing close, "_What, is this?_ Haven't seen this before. Dunno why a Blade would be stuck... with a bunch of wounds... _And they're exactly the same as Rex's!_"

![Innocently looking at each other](images/096_innocent_looking.jpg)

And the two that hadn't thought about that before looked at each other innocently, had no idea as well. 

---

The others had gathered around them, including Yew and Zuo joining. Vandham: "Incredible. Never heard of such a thing."

"It's all true." The X crystal in his heart shone the most brightly. 

"I just thought... _it was an accessory._"

"Vandham, that's not my style."

"**Blades are supposed to heal up** right away, no matter what the wound. _If the crystal's in one piece and the Driver's alive, nothing can touch 'em._ So why's she all bashed up?"

"That's just how the chips fell. It is what it is." He took it for granted, assuming it's something to do with the Aegis special entity. 

"What it is, _is a problem._ It means, if one of you kicks the **bucket**, you both do."

"You told me that a good Driver, **always** protects his Blade. So that's what I'll do. I'm gonna protect her."

"_Eaaasier said than done, kid._"

"Listen. Pyra... _She saved my life, brought me back from the dead._ So I won't die again! I've got to live, for her sake! Until we... get to Elysium, at least. We can make it together."

"Rex, you mean..."

A voice of unknown suddenly sounded from behind, "Going to Elysium? I can't let that stand." Looking behind, Vandham found a stranger appearing behind them without them feeling it. "It. Won't. Do. A bunch of _amateurs_ stealing the show? The **script** exists for a **reason**!"

Nia: "Akhos!"

"Please, _speak only when you're spoken to, **traitor**._"

Obrona chimed, "**Traitor traitor TRAITOR!!! Nia, you're one of the baddies now. You villain! Teehehehe!**"

"**I didn't betray *anyone*!**"

Akhos: "Then why do you stand with them? You think that is where you belong?"

"B-b-but I-I..."

Vandham was angry, "Hmph! Who are these **goons**?"

Rex explained, "Torna. They're **trying** to get their hands on Pyra."

That enraged him further, "**TORNAAAA!!!**"

Nia: "**Akhos! Just, tell us, what you're here for!**"

"Well, the Aegis, of course. I just had to come and see the leading lady with my own eyes."

"Jin put you up to this?"

"Well deduced. **Oh**, by the way... His orders were to deal with you _in whatever manner I see fit. So... you know what that means._"

"_He wouldn't..._ **You're lying!**"

"**Why the surprise? Did** you think he would still _care about you?_ **Ohhh**, to live in your *reality*..."

"Angh!{{footnote: Like a cat non-meow crying out.}}"

"Well well. Your **part** in this **play** is _coming to an end._ So! _Time for you to shuffle off the stage._"

"**HRRRRRNNNGGGHHHH!!!**" What words did he dare to speak in my village! 

Rex asked, "What's wrong?"

"I know the name Torna. They've taken the lives of too many Drivers. Including some of my crew. Good people. _Rumor says it's because they're collecting Core Crystals. So, if this Akhos is one of them..._ **Yew! Zuo! Get everyone out of the village!**"

"**Yes, sir!**" both chanted. 

"**You ready?**"

Rex: "**Ready.**" And they had to fend them off before the others get to safety. 

Pyra: "Got it."

Nia: "_Thanks for this._"

Rex: "**No problem.**"

"It'll be tough. His Blade, Obrona... _She can manipulate the ether in the air. It lets him ocunter elemental attacks by generating **fields** of the oppsing elements!_"

Vandham: "**Finally**, a decent opponent for a change! **Let's go!**" And the battle begun. 

---

Halfway through the fight, Akhos was excited, "**Such an honor! Sharing a stage with the legendary, AEGIS!**"

He jumped forward quick and slashed on Pyra, "**ARRRRGHHHH!!!**" as she bashed on the rocky walls, hurting him as well. 

"Ugh!" 

Akhos noticed, felt confused, "_Huh? Why would the Driver..._"

Obrona: "It seems... that they're taking each other's damage, somehow." She was releasing red particles from her body to manipulate ether. The red particles filled the stage, controlling its vicinity. 

![Obrona releasing red particles](images/097_obrona_releasing_red_particles.jpg)

"_Ahhh... So that means that the Aegis... Is a mere mortal right now..._" He looked at Pyra, whom shielded her arms of injuries. She care not to fall before her enemy. "In that case, a little more damage, and she'll be **easy to deal with!**" 

And he started running towards her, while she tried to dodge despite her body not totally listening to her commands. Along the walls they fought, his sword easily cutting through the rocks. Her speed cannot match him. "**ARRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!**"

"**Pyra!**" As she fell to the ground unconscious, he felt a jolt in his chest, and down to the floor he went. He was about to take one more attack when a shield raised around her. 

"Hngh!" Knocked him back, a wind bringing sandstorm grew. 

"Kids these days, I swear! Can't leave you alone for a minute!" Vandham entered the scene. 

Rex: "**Could use a hand!**"

"Leave it to me. I'll take this dog **down**!" Sandstorm tornado launched at Akhos, 

"Ugh!"

Obrona: "**UAAHHHHHHHHH!!! What's happening?!**" She started swirling with the tornado, unable to release her red particles anymore. 

Akhos was surprised, "What? **The ether flow's disturbed!** Grh! How am I supposed to deflect **now?!**"

Vandham: "You and your fancy moves. You lack grit." No deflecting, he aimed to attack him face to face. Passing through the sandstorm, he could not see Dromarch biting Nia's ring in his mouth and poached, sliced at him just after he exited the sandstorm. 

With a handsome roll and getting back on the ground, Obrona joined him, "Huh... Just too many of these bit-players..." All had been facing him alone. It's time to leave. "**My interest has waned. Obrona! Perhaps its time for another tale.**"

"Meeerggghhh... Sure, sure." And they ran away. 

"Tch." Vandham was unwilling to let him go, but now that he'd gone, he couldn't retain him. Nia, on the other hand, had more thinking about Akhos's words on Jin, now that the battle is over and it took over her mind. Dromarch sensed her sadness, didn't disturb her. 

Pyra had woke up, but she was lumping forward, one step by one, as if a dehydrated person at a desert trying to move but found no oasis in the vicinity. A few more steps toward Rex and she dropped to the ground. Rex, watching the other direction, heard the thump and just remembered, "**Pyra!**" He dashed towards her, brought her in his arms, "**Pyra! Pyra!**"

![Pyra fainted](images/098_pyra_fainted.jpg)

---

They put her on a bed, gathered around her. No signs of her waking yet. Rex leave his team looking after her, walked out of the tent to Vandham. "How is she?" Vandham asked. 

"She's not badly hurt. Dromarch... thinks she just needs rest."

"That's good to hear."

He blamed himself, "_Maybe... I used too much power again..._"

"_Hey, Rex..._"

"Hmm?"

"Know what the difference is... between me and the Akhos fella?"

"Well, he's a bad guy, trying to get Pyra... _and you're_... not?"

"**Hahahah!!!** Thanks for the vote of confidence, kid. _What if I told you... that we weren't that different?_"

"Huh?"

"My crew at the village, **we think** we're fighting for **justice**. _But a just fight? I'm tellin' you now, there's no such **thing**._ What people call justice? It's just **an excuse** to fight. **War** is war. The more you stand up for yourself, _the more people wanna fight you. Before you know it, you're in a war._ Listen. _All I'm saying is_, we got our fight, and he's go this."

He can't put himself in Akhos's shoes, rebutted, "But what he's doing is-"

"_Yeah, it's bad. But war ain't about right and wrong. Power. That's all it is._ And power can take many different forms. _It depends on the heart of its wielder._ If we don't use our power, just 'cos we're scared of it, we're **done for.** _As for who's right... and who's wrong..._ No one knows for sure. _So_, all we can do, is **protect**... what's important."

"I think I understand." He turned around and looked through the door where Pyra laid. 

"**We all got our own war, kid.**"

"My... war?" The seeds had been planted, but it needs time to germinate. He may not yet understand, but it won't be long. The roads they walk, the water and nutrients they are. Only in walking can he understand, what does she means for him, and he for her. 

---

"**Good morning!**" Pyra walked in with Nia and Poppi to the boys' tents. 

Rex was overwhelmed, "**Pyra! Feeling better?**"

"Yeah! I slept **so** much!"

"Good. Glad to hear."

"Also... Nia's got something to talk to you about."

"She does?"

"Yeah. Go ahead, Nia."

"Ah, erm..." In front of so many people? She felt shy. "I... Rex... I-I-I want you to come help me."

"Ermmmm, come where?"

"To Vandham. I need to tell him about... my past with Akhos and all that lot."

"Ah, **sure**! If you'd like me to, **I will!**"

"Thanks!"

Pyra shared, "Nia... originally said, she was going to go alone. But I said- maybe it'd be better- if you went along too."

"Er... Maybe I should explain... Vandham... _He... kind of scares me a bit..._"

"**Hahah! I get it!**"

---

Vandham was at the training ground overlooking the new recruits training when everyone was approaching him. He shouted out, "**Oh, it's you guys? What go you out of bed** so early?"

Rex: "Nia?"

She walked forward and took the stage, "Thanks for yesterday. You saved our skins. That guy, A-Akhos, I mean... I wanted to tell you about him... you see... **Thing is, we used to be...**"

He cut her off, "Being a mercenary, you meet all kindsa different folks."

"Huh?"

"_Your country, family, money_... People got plenty of reasons to fight. _Like fightin' for a special girl._ I see that a lot. _Though not every girl has a strange crystal in her chest, eh?_"

Rex: "Y-y-you mean Pyra? W-we're just..."

Vandham: "Nia, _you're with these guys right now._ **_That's what matters._**"

"**But... aren't you...**" She was so confused right now; she had not the chance to speak her story. But Vandham had already accepted her, a former member of Torna, which he might've guessed from their conversations yesterday. She don't know what to say. 

"**Anyway. Rex, weren't you saying you wanted** to get to Elysium?"

"Yeah... But, we hit a snag... With a monster like that in the way, it's impossible. No Guild ship's getting close to it, without going down."

"Well, I've got an old mate. In the Urayan capital. Got a feeling he might know a way through."

"**Really?!!**"

"**Yeah!** I gotta go there anyhow. So I could introduce you."

"**Vandham! Thank you!**"

"Nah! **It's destiny** or something. Don't sweat it. **Get your stuff together,** and meet me by the village entrance." And he walked away.

At the village entrance, the group and Vandham met Yew and Zuo, biding farewell. Vandham: "Time to head out. **Yew! Zuo!** Take care of this place, yeah?"

"Nae worries. Leave it to us, Boss!"

"**Boss. You're in a good mood, somehow!**"

"**Eheheheh!!** I guess so. Well, take care!" And they took off, with Yew and Zuo watching them off. 

Unbeknownst to them, behind the rocks outside the entrance hid some people also overwatching their journey. Two person, actually, probably one is his/her blade. They both had hoods over the heads, but the guy taking the weapon was presumably the Driver, and such muscularity, perhaps a guy. The other green hair ones, wearing huge glasses. They spoke not a word.

On the other side, a Titan ship was floating above the Cloud Sea when the emergency alarm sounded, it tilting to its side, about to wreck. Soldiers were dispatched; but they were no fight for Jin. Every step he walked, all fell to the ground, forming a meat wall. His sword sliced through so quickly they had not fell their flesh disintegrated into shards. The Blades just saw their Drivers fell dead, had not the slightest time to react, immediately turning back to Core Crystals. In front of the door of his destination, multiple slices and it slammed to the ground, its shards. Within was rows upon rows of Core Crystals. With explosion, the Titan ship went down, sunk below the ocean.
