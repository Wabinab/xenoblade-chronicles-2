# New Friends

===

Walking through the burnt down village once more, Jin, Mikhail, and Haze were following close behind her, whom had been looking at the floor while she walked for a moment. Her mind was still blank from earlier revelation, and she don't yet know how to find salvation. 

"Surround them!" In front of them, suddenly, a Mor Ardain captain ordered. 

"Huh?" Addam watched as they were aimed by bayonets-armed crossbows. To their sides and behind them, there's nowhere left to run. He was surprised, "Ardainian troops? Imperial Guard?!"

"Thieving scum! **Don't think** you're gonna get away with your dirty deeds!" The captain folded his arm and mocked. 

Feeling misunderstood, Lora tried to explain, "_What?_ **No! We just-**"

"Problem, Captain?" A girl wearing blue high heels and purple long skirt walked into the scene. A long hair of purple, with blue flames smoldering on the tips of her hair. When she walked past, the Captain stood as straight as he could, pushing his chest forward and raising his head. Some test-tube like bottles containing orange liquids connected by strings dangled to her right hip. Flames too raised beside her ears. On her forehead was something that looked like a small arrow penetrating 90Â° into another larger arrow, somewhat parallel to her eyebrows. Her eyes always closed; and she'd fair skins. 

When she entered the scene, everyone in the group focused on her. 

![Brighid](images/380_brighid.jpg)

The Captain stood at her 8 o'clock, quietly reported, "Lady Brighid! They're brigands. Same ones who attacked the village, perhaps!"

Her eyes may not be opened, but she can sense very clearly. "Drivers and Blades... _Mercenaries?_"

Addam turned his back to the soldiers, commented, "So that's Brighid..."

"Captain. **I**- shall deal with these individuals. Emperor Hugo **must** be briefed."

"Yes, ma'am." (She drew out her truncheon, prepared for battle, while the Captain ordered,) "You lot! Stay here and assist the Lady Brighid."

"**Sir!**" The battle hence begun. 

---

"**ARRRGGGHHH!!!**" Addam sliced through an arrow shot at him, the clash emanates sparks. He thrusted forward and fell two of the soldiers with their bayonets crossbow aiming at him. On the other side, Lora wrapped her whip around one of the soldier's crossbow and pull it off his hand, while Jin came up from behind and sliced him and another soldier coming up to help out. 

"Not done with you!" Mythra pointed her sword at Brighid, shot a beam that she raised to protect. "**YRRRRAAAGGGHHHH!!!**" When she dropped back onto the ground, she launched herself fast at her, clashing sword to truncheon. Her twin truncheon changed form and became a whip immersed in blue flames, adeptly swirled around her like a professional yo-yo player performing tricks. 

She jumped into the air, "**YARGHH!!**" Blue flames split into 6 globules landed around Mythra, raising a wall. 

"**MUARRRGHHH!!!**" One slash and she extinguished them. "Ooooooohhhh, **COME ON!!! That was-** a pretty cheap trick!" She then teased, "Keep going like that, you'll get a reputation!"

She dropped back to the ground, looked at Mythra with her nostrils, answered, "Cheap, you say? **Don't** be absurd. It's called tactics, look it up. But perhaps that's something a **simpleton** like yourself could **never** hope to **comprehend!**" Her truncheon once more changed form to a whip that came straight at Mythra. 

"Urgh!" Her hands busy, she had not the attention to rebut. Only once she slashed it away could she repeated, "A simpleton?"

"**Your** attacks scream it. Clumsy, heavy, _no refinement_..."

"Urgh... I was gonna go easy on you, but now...? Now, you **PISSED ME OFF!!!**" The crystal on her forehead shone bright green. 

Addam, noticing it, and no soldiers coming at him currently, shouted, "**Mythra, Stop! We've got children here!**" He looked behind him, where Milton and Mikhail hid behind the trunk of a tree. 

But it's too late. Brighid sensed a particle beam struck from beyond the sky, aiming straight at her. Before it hit her, she jumped out from the targeting beam and the zone being influenced. "Ngh! What was **THAT?!** If _that_ had **actually** hit me..."

Now it's Mythra teasing her, putting her sword on the back of her neck, "Ohhh? Didn't like that, did you? Tsk! I can see it on your face! Well, on that note..." Once more the crystal shone bright. 

"**MYTHRA!!!**"

"**Haze!**" Lora called out. They had to stop her. 

"Understood." She stuck her staff on the ground and the crystal emanates a warm wave that brushed through, then she raised it over her head, raising a huge field that engulfed the whole battlefield. 

"Nggghhhh... Wh-what?" Mythra felt her powers dimmed down, and she felt like kneeling down. "B-but... How?"

Brighid was even worse, "**HORRRGHGHHH!!!**" She couldn't resist it anymore, knelt first before Mythra did. 

"Is this..." She strenuously turned her head to her left, asked, "you? **What the hell? She's our... enemy!**"

Lora sternly spoke, "Addam plainly ordered you to stop. Or didn't you hear him? _Simpleton._"

"Grrhhh..." She stumbled, resisting strongly not to go on the ground. 

Brighid was impressed even when she couldn't resist, "How extraordinary... I'd heard of a Blade with the power to **restrain others, but I never thought...** And, did she say Addam?" She looked to the guy who shouted orders just now. "It can't be..."

"All of you, lay down your arms!" A boy wearing armor, accompanied by someone wearing white worker boots with short heels and a cloak that stretched just a few centimeters above the ground, walked into the scene. Behind them was the reporting captain. The group's attention turned to him. Brighid strenuously turned her head to look at him, the restraint on her still ongoing... 

![Hugo and Aegaeon](images/381_hugo_aegaeon.jpg)

A boy wearing plates with two flag-like pendant with a dark-turquoise diamond-shaped crystal fitted at the end hang from both side of his chest. The white-worker boots wearer was presumably his humanoid-form rare Blade, with 3 soft tube-like 'hair' screwed to the top back of his head, dangling behind, and wrapped around the rest of his body, with visible light blue bubble-contained fluid flowing within. His arm caught on to a sheathed sword. 

Addam had came up and stood beside Mythra, whom had finally knelt on the ground. The guy stopped and said, "There is no- need for this."

![Hugo](images/382_hugo.jpg)

Addam first went down and put his arm on her shoulder. She pushed up straight and looked into his eyes, which he sternly looked back. "Grrrgh..." She had no choice but to sheath her sword. He then looked behind to Lora and nodded. She exchanged glance with Haze, and she agreed to stop exerting forces on them. Feeling the pressure loosened, she dropped on both  hands, panting. Addam softly patted on both her shoulder, took them and helped her up. 

While he let her immersed in her guilt, he turned his attention to the boy, called out, "**Hello!**"

The boy faced him and smiled. 

---

Addam and the boy walked closer to each other, he felt content and sincerely apologized, "It's good to see you again, Prince Addam. Please- forgive- the actions of my guards."

Hospitality high as usual, he reassured, "**Don't you worry** about it. I'm just **glad** to see you well, Your Imperial Majesty."

Lora, listening to their conversation, was trying to decode what he meant by "Imperial... Majesty?"

"**May I introduce...** The Emperor of Mor Ardain, Hugo- Ardanach."

"The Ardainian Emperor?!" Her voice sounded dull, but more like scratching her head virtually, "What's someone of his station doing out here?"

Addam don't agree, corrected her, "**You know, OUR stations** are fairly similar..."

"_Not that you'd ever know..._" Mythra complaint. 

"Thanks! I try."

"I've come for the Aegis." Hugo went straight to the topic. They turned their attention back to him. "Its actions have been felt in Mor Ardain, as well. We're currently chasing it down."

"The same as _us, then..._ But coming here _yourself?_"

"My brother- is ruling in my absence."

"I see... And so you brought Brighid and Aegaeon...?"

"Huh?" Lora and the others were surprised. They turned their attention back to the woman blade that attacked them earlier, and the Blade standing behind Hugo. "Those two are the Crown Jewels of the Ardainian forces. Wielding them on the front lines is the _duty- of he who has the throne._"

![Aegaeon](images/383_aegaeon.jpg)

Hugo agreed, "Indeed... That ought to have been my older brother."

"But he didn't have the potential to become a Driver. And now, _here you are_... bonded with _both of them._" He then turned his attention to the Captain, his smile thinned somewhat, and Hugo followed his glance. He introduced, 

"This Special Inquisitor- is under my brother's direct command."

![Special Inquisitor](images/384_special_inquisitor.jpg)

"**Ohhh!**"

"Should I fall in battle, **he has** his orders to retrieve- the Core Crystals."

"That sounds cold..." Lora commented. 

Addam wasn't surprised, "That's how it goes with _matters of state._"

"And yet... It works out well for me." Hugo shared. "I have always wanted to put myself on the line- for our people. And I never enjoyed- wielding authority in the first place."

"I **feel the same way! I don't get why** anyone would want to sit on a throne."

"Yes, that? If Prince Zettar knew, there would be consequences."

"**Let's... pretend** you _didn't_ hear me say that."

He constricted his eyes a little, commented, "You two will never see eye to eye. Better to leave well enough alone."

"Ruling is... Frankly, it's a scary thought. **Just imagine**, becoming someone you _don't recognize_...{{footnote: Power corrupts is real. People always choose someone kind and with high hospitality, willing to listen to them speaks, willing to change, etc. to rule the throne. But as they sat on the throne longer and longer, they change. And because news reports only the bad, what you heard are the consequences of (s)he whom'd been transformed by powers. And they didn't even realize, thinking that's how they originally think.}} Never knowing _who's looking **back** at you_ in the mirror..."

A moment of silence as they digest his words. Hugo then asked, "Prince Addam. I'd be happy if you call me Hugo, like old times."

"**I will,** dear Hugo. **But only** if you'll call me Addam in return." He kindly nodded. Addam then get to the point, "**Well,** it would be beneficial to share our findings. **But perhaps** elsewhere might be better?"

"How about Your Majesty's flagship?" Aegaeon suggested. 

Hugo agreed, "Indeed."

"Flag... ship?" Now that's something that bothered her. 

"Is something the matter, Lady Lora?" Haze wondered. 

She tried to sound like it's not very serious, "I-I'm just... not very good in that kind of stuffy environment..."

Mythra immediately agreed, "**Oh you're not alone there!** That's the WORST!"

"**Right?!**" She turned to Addam, said, "**I think...** I'll sit this particular venture out."

"**Yeah, I'm out too!**" She turned around and about to go when she felt a strong grip on her arm, 

"**OHHHH NO** you don't." She immediately looked very annoyed. 

Hugo's eyes widened, "_Wait a minute..._ Is that her?"

Addam introduced, "Yes. This is Mythra, _one of the Aegises._"

"Ngh..." She really don't like this kind of introduction. 

He turned to Lora, "**Your account** would be _valuable as well, Lora._"

"Everything I've seen or heard, Jin will know as well."

Huh? Someone's calling me? "Ah, y-yes, that's true."

She turned to him, quietly pleaded, "_Pleaaaaaaase, would you go instead of me please?_"

He never forget his promise. He first turned to Haze, whom nodded back to him in assurance. He shook his head, then look to Hugo, speaking in a zombie-like voice, "Of- course. I will do as you wish."

"Thank you, kindly." All set, he asked, "Well then, shall we?"

Indol. Along the dark corridor with small ether lamps to the side of each pillar that acted only as lighthouse, but did not lit the corridor a single bit, a young sharp-chin blue-skin guy with thick white eyebrows and sharp eyes, two thick strands of hair fell down the side of his face, a large long nose, and ears the shape of fins, seemingly wearing a cap, took quick steps emotionlessly. His mind went back to when he was in a room with the Indol's crest painted on the glass translucent window behind the podium, standing with someone else looking at the podium, which is a giant trophy-like object placed atop a hosting pillar. 

![Amalthus](images/386_amalthus.jpg)

![The room, the design, the window](images/385_the_room.jpg)

"Interesting thing you've got there." The guy and Praetor Rhadallis turned around and watched Malos approaching them. He walked straight, and to pass between them, he teleported through, and continued walking till he reached the foot of the trophy, looking up at it. 

"Malos, enough." The guy, Malos's Driver, Amalthus, ordered calmly. 

"It's all right." Praetor Rhadallis said. "Indol's most sacred treasure. The Aegis. It is said to be the embodiment of the Architect's light... The divine revelations our founder Meldinare received."

"Really?" Malos wondered. "Then... "

He stretched his hand forward and aimed it at the trophy, dark energy gathered on the palm of his hand. Both wondered what he's gonna do when the trophy shattered into thousands of shards. He finished, "... that's what I will be called, too. After all, I am born... _of divinity, not just some reflection._"

"You believe yourself _so strong?_" Praetor Rhadallis asked calmly, seemingly not bothered by his action nor the loss of the heritage. 

"_Huh..._ Don't you?"

---

"Your situation doesn't look good; Baltrich is not going to let it go."

Amalthus stopped. The guy, a short blue fellow wearing metallic glasses with 4 holes to North South East West each, wearing a red cloak that cover his head. He continued, "And you can't hide behind the Praetor forever..."

"That has nothing to do with you."

"If that were true, you wouldn't- _be here._"

"Mhrmm..." Amalthus opened his eyes wide. 

"HrrrrrrrrrHAHAHAHAHA!!!" The guy turned around and walked away. Amalthus followed. "Here."

The door opened and they walked past, side by side. 

"What is this place?" He stopped behind the old man, whom went up to the panel with a glowing blue ball in the middle of the well, and meddled with it. The door behind them closed. 

"It's a very tasty secret... Formerly known only to the Praetor- and me. The essence of our Judician forbears, originally salvaged from the **bottom** of the Cloud Sea. Some of it may hail from the fabled Land of Morytha..."

"_Morytha...?_"

"Look." The blue ball shone brighter, and a hologram formed atop it. Several blue rings showed the boundary of the 3D cylindrical 'screen', drawing out 2 DNA pairs in it, one green, one orange, side by side. "This here display is a diagram of what human cells are made of." (He moved his eyes from the orange to the green.) "And then this one here is a Blade's."

![DNA](images/387_dna.jpg)

"Astonishingly alike."

"Of course. After all, they are descended from humans too. That in and of itself isn't **too** shocking... _But this..._"

The screen removed the Blade's DNA to show only human's. The orange ring below fluctuates on its circumference like electricity dancing, or like the graph of a stock market's volatility. 

"It's the same, isn't it?" Amalthus can't see any difference. 

"_Just wait..._"

Thousands and millions and billions of DNA chains ordered in random sequences, connecting to many globules of largely formed structures that looked like worms or clusters, that was small compared to the layers upon layers of even more larger structures that looked like flat pieces making up different levels, and millions of such levels formed the shape of a Core Crystal. 

"_Huh... That... that's a..._ Core Crystal." exclaimed Amalthus. 

"Exactly. A Blade's Core Crystal contains information not only pertaining to humans... It also records schematics describing alllllll manner of animal tissues."

![Old man and Amalthus](images/389_old_man_and_amalthus.jpg)

"You're saying- Blades- contain detailed information of alllll living creatures?"

"Not- just that." (The screen changed to a structure that looked like a horoscope) "Have a look at this undeveloped part."

He brought up a similar green one and show the web-like structure side by side. 

![Undeveloped structure](images/388_undeveloped_structure.jpg)

"That is from a Titan." (Then, bringing the two together and merge them, said,) "It suggests that this... particular piece may one day develop **into** a Titan. **Isn't it mind-boggling?** A message from the Architect, no doubt."

![Merged structure](images/390_merged_structure.jpg)

"From the... Architect..." We don't know what he's thinking, but his eyes focused on the structure, he didn't seemed too surprised either, judging by his emotions and reactions. 

The old man turned around and reaffirmed, "**Indeed.** This is **just** what you were after. I wish to investigate this, and learn more of what the Architect has in store for this world. And, _perhaps, claim this knowledge for our own._" He looked at the sky as if he would one day be divine. 

Amalthus looked at him through the bottom of his eyes without tilting down his head, "Including- the Praetor?"

"Per-haps..."

Amalthus clenched his fist so strongly he couldn't help but vibrate. The old man seemed not to notice what he's doing, or perhaps he did but ignored it, said, "Isn't this _in line... with your own goals? Well then, I may as well help out._"

Amalthus looked up, already calmed himself down.
