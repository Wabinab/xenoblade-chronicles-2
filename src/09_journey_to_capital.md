# Bringer of Chaos, Fonsa Myma

===

Walking out of the tunnels, nobody was speaking. Suddenly, a laugh intruded the silence, echoing through the environment, 

"**Ahahahah!** Look like all the chat about the Aegis was true!" The group looked around to find the source of the voice, to no avail. 

"**Who're you?**" asked Rex. 

He revealed himself in front of the group. That's the muscular man and the other glasses girl. He continued speaking, "**That's a heavy burden you have there. Sure you're up to it, pipsqueak?** See sense, step aside, and let the **big boys** take charge. C'mon. **Yield** the **merchandise**!" Of course, how could it not come with dabbing and zabbing moves, to show that they're the 'big boys'? 

![Fancy openings you have there](images/101_fancy_moves.jpg)

The group was so confused. Rex voiced for them, "Huh? What? Vandham, do you know this guy?"

"Never seen him in my life."

"**BAH!!**" And both removed their hoodie, revealing themselves. 

"**HUH!!**" What just happened? 

![Revealing themselves](images/102_revealing_themselves.jpg)

The man had an eyepatch covering his left eye, like a pirate, with scruffy hair, and his shirt doesn't zip in properly to show his muscular chest. A belt zap across his chest, perhaps to hold items. The woman had a lightbulb on her head and her elbow, green hair, probably his Blade. 

Rex: "**Wait... are you...**"{{footnote: Gramps climbed out of the helmet to look closer.}} 

The guy awaited for his praise. What could he say? What will he say? Come on, praise me, praise me! Finally, you realize, right? "Huh."

![Huh](images/104_huh.jpg)

"_Uh..._" 

![Uh](images/103_nothing_spurt_out.jpg)

Broke their pose. The group tilted their head, he and his Blade overreacted by tilting their whole body. 

![Talk about overreacting](images/105_talk_about_overreacting.jpg)

As he bent back, putting his hand behind to support his slipped waist, the fury that raged through his chest burnt high and wide. How could they? How could they had not know? "**You really are a bunch of rinky-dink, bogus, two-bit, no-mark Drivers, aren't you?**" Step by step, they approached the group, showing off their chest meanwhile, as he introduced, "**Behold the mighty... ZEKE. VON. GENBU! BRINGER OF CHAOS!**"

![Zeke von Genbu](images/106_zeke_von_genbu.jpg)

He continued, "**Mostly known as Zeke. And often addressed as... THE ZEKENATOR!!!**" The introduction was not without splattering saliva, showering on the group like raining flowers. His introduction is finished, now for, "**Behold, my Blade! Pannnnn-doria!**"

![Pandoria](images/107_pandoria.jpg)

And he pulled out the weapon from his back; cannot forget to introduce his beloved weapon, eh? He had wiped it, cleaned, it, polished it, and waxed it every single day, new as ever. "**And this is my word, the Purple Lightning Dreamsmasher! If you want a taste, come- and- get it!**"

![Purple Lightning Dreamsmasher](images/108_dreamsmasher.jpg)

So dumbstruck the group had not yet recovered from what to say of this duo. Calmly, Rex replied, "We're good." Then, he and his friends walked past them, not looking back. 

Zeke cannot believed his reactions, stutteringly tilted his head, exclaimed, "**Good?! No! W-w-wait...**" With incredible speed, he rounded around them and landed in front of them once more, "**Wait! You BARBARIANS!!!**"

Nia commented, "This guy... I'm tired of him already."

"Gah! You think you lowlifes, can **lick** the three of us?"

"Three of you? I could, _two_. Lost someone?"

Oh yeah, they'd forgotten to introduced him. How could they'd forgotten? "Huh? Oh, get a load of this... Our **beloved mascot... Turters, REVEAL yourself!**" He stuck his hand into his chest and searched for it, rubbed here, rubbed there, to no avail. The panicky air started to rise as his tone turned from calm to proud to worry, "_Huh?_ Turters? Turters? Turters, **w-w-where are you, boy? TURTERRRRRSSS!!!**"  

The group was also looking around to help them search for the missing one. Pyra was eyeing the ground when she saw something crawling below her feet. She took her feet off once to reveal the tiny little creature. "**Oh!**" She bent down and took it by hand, "Hello, little guy! How are you? What are you doing, out here all alone...?"

![Turters](images/109_turters.jpg)

Zeke was searching on the ground when her voice intruded his attention. With a zap, his head swung to position and saw the beloved Turters she was teasing with her little fingers. 

![Searching for Turters](images/110_searching_for_turters.jpg)

"**Ah-ah-ah! Turters!**" 

![Found Turters](images/111_found_turters.jpg)

With incredible speed, he approached Pyra and snatched Turters away while she was awestruck, "Handling a man's turtle!" With incredible speed, he dashed back to where Pandoria stood; they both looked at Turters by hand, was relieved it was alive and safe, rejoiced its return. 

Rex was ever more confused, "Urrrr... He could have just... grabbed Pyra there. Why'd he go for his turtle instead?"

Nia had had enough, "Ugh. What an idiot."

The word 'idiot' had triggered their attention. What, how could you have called the mighty ZEKE the ZEKENATOR an idiot, you Barbarian! "...Gah... Listen, whata **whatever.** She'll be mine soon enough!" Pointing at Pyra. "**GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT? THEN COOOOOME AT ME!** Andddd **DON'T HOLD BACK!!!**" 

With full mighty force, he pointed his sword once again at them, not forgetting to wink and used his handsomeness to lure Pyra. 

![The Zekenator using his handsomeness to lure Pyra](images/112_wink.jpg)

Nia couldn't distinguish between seriousness and playfulness anymore, "What! Is this guy, for real?" But they summoned their weapons anyways, prepared for battle. 

---

Dragged along the ground, he was a little tired of the battling. "(pant pant pant) _G-good try. Not bad._ Bu-bu-bu-bu-but! Wipe yourselves down, and get ready for my super-**ultra-MEGA-MOVE!!!**"

Nia urged: "We're waiting with bated breath. For your super-duper-whatever." 

How could you? How could you? **How could you?** Electric sparkles on his body surface as electrical ether elements gathered at incredible speed. "**You asked for it! HYYAAARRRRGGGHHHH!!!**" The force was so strong the group had difficulty withstanding the shockwaves it released. 

![Super Ultra Mega Move](images/113_super_ultra_mega_move.jpg)

"**BRINGER OF CHAOS!!! ULTIMATE LIGHTNING FURY SLASH!!!**" And he slashed on the ground so strongly the lightning brightness blinded their view. Except, too bad, he hit the wrong place, did no damage to the ground except carving a letter on the ground. 

![Ultimate Lightning Fury Slash](images/114_ultimate_lightning_fury_slash.jpg)

The electric sparkles dissipated not longer. He got up with his sword still stuck to the ground, "Huh!" Are you scared? Are you now scared? Now that you witnessed my Ultimate Lightning Fury Slash, shall you willingly handled the Aegis to the Big Boys, that is, Me?! You sure do, right? One've not hit you on purpose, but not the next, if you did not hand it to me now. 

Except, the ground started cracking where his sword hit, and the group backed a few steps. 

"Erm..." Pyra wanted to warn him, but his eyes and his grin was still facing them, unbeknownst to the ground below him. 

"**Whoaaaaa!!!**" The crack grew larger and larger as they tried to balance themselves, until the whole cliff collapsed, "**WRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!!!**" Bringing the chaos and rocks away with them to the lake below. 

Rex was as confused as usual, "Wh-what just happened? They..."

Nia: "Ugh... What an idiot."

Vandham was satisfied with the entertainment, "Don't see that everyday..."

Nia urged, "Come on. That's enough nonsense."

Dromarch agreed, "Indeed."

Rex looked at Pyra and 'reluctantly' leave. Hopefully the two was alright... Poppi watched the group's reaction before following, step by step, swinging her hands robotically. None leaves a second thought of his fate. 

---

The watery village by the entrance leading to the top. Buildings stacking on top of each other, accessible by stairs. This, is **Fonsa Myma, Capital.**

![Fonsa Myma 1](images/115_fonsa_myma_1.jpg)

![Fonsa Myma 2](images/116_fonsa_myma_2.jpg)

---

Turquoise grass paved the various rings of fields before entrance to the City. AT the dock parked a giant new-looking Titan ship, unloading cargoes, or maybe loading cargoes. Salvagers were gathering outside, chatting. The group was near the ship. 

![Uraya's Warship](images/117_uraya_warship.jpg)

Dromarch noted, "War, with Mor Ardain, is looking more and more likely by the day."

Vandham added, "Looks like they've _expanded the military program. That's a lot of warships._"

Poppi: "These ships, look different to normal ships."

"Yeah. We don't much about with our Titans much. No need for it. Urayans like things pretty natural."

Rex: "I've seen Urayan ships before, back in Argentum. It's like the **total** opposite of how the Ardainians use them."

Dromarch: "That could be one reason they're- always at each other's throats."

Gramps added, "They've been like cats and dogs for a **long** time..."

Nia expressed, "Well, from where I stand, the Ardainians are worse. All that metal's just bad taste."

"It's easy to think that way, but you're not considering, how the Titans **themselves** feel."

"Huh? Don't all those modifications hurt?"

"When Titans live with humans, that's just the way it is."

"_Hmm..._"

"I used to have a hut on my back, and a crane, stuck where the sun _doesn't shine._ I never complained, not even when Rex fired up a grill on my shoulders."

Rex rebutted, "**Hey, you used to like that!**"

"Mm... Well, yes, I did like that. In fact, I miss it..."

"If I did that now, we'd end up with a roast Titan!"

"Indeed!"

"**Uhuhuhuhuh!!!**" Pyra laughed at their exchanging jokes. 

---

Entering the city, people were queuing in front of a reception desk.{{footnote: Yes, reception desk usually build inside a building to greet you when you enter it, but who says you can't build one at the front door of a city to greet you when you enter the city?}} Rex wondered, "What's that?"

Vandham explained, "It's a distribution center. The government tries to ration out what little resources they have. In practice, it's just first come, first served."

Just then, the girl with green hair received, "OK. That's the last one for today."

"Hah!" She held out her hand to embrace. One more day without fasting. But she felt gratitude too fast. Someone buff went by and knocked her out of her way as she went for the ground, kissing it, and the buff guy took her place. 

"Ah!" Pyra felt shocked, ran for the girl. 

The buff guy took the cup at hand, complaint, "Come on! I'm a soldier! Been busting my gut for this country! That should be going to **me. Not the likes of you!**"

The girl got back on her feet, felt too scared to revolt against authority; but that's her savings. She'd queued so long just for this; but her effete muscles, drained from fasting, had no fight for the soldier. Tears were to roll down her cheeks, but she sniffed it back. She wanted to get it back, but her feet stuck to the ground stiff. 

The soldier don't like her look, "**Uh? Don't** look at me like that! **Respect your elders, you snot-nosed BRAT!!!**"

Just then, Pyra arrived beside her, questioned, "_Are you OK?_" Then looked at the soldier, "**What do you think you're doing? She's just a child!**" Rex had followed his Blade and shielded her behind him. 

"**Whaaaaaat?!**" What's the matter with a child? Everyone here goes hungry a day or not, who cares if she's a child or an old lady when one's what's important is one's belly? "Huh? **Huh? Who the hell are you?**"

The rest caught up behind, with Nia persuading, "Rex... This isn't our business. **Leave it!**"

"Urgh! Being an adult isn't just about barking orders. **Sometimes, you need to help someone weaker!**" shouted Rex to the soldier. 

"Urgh! **Shut your face! You _don't know_, what the **hell you're talking about!**" And he summoned his weapon, twin ring, and his blade, a standard tiger. And the battle begin, with others originally in line and those distributing already gone, none of their business. 

![Soldier and his Tiger Blade](images/118_soldier_and_tiger.jpg)

---

"_Huh_ **Huh**... Wh-**who are you?**" Then, he looked closely at Pyra, backed a few steps, "Huh... Th-the color of **that crystal! You're...! ERRRRAAAARRRGGGGHHHHH!!!**" And he ran away, up the stairs. 

"Not good. He'll be bringing others before long." exclaimed Gramps. 

Vandham: "The rumors about Pyra must have _traveled pretty far. Even grunts like_ **him** have heard 'em."

Pyra felt "Sorry... I guess, I should have used the cloak...{{footnote: Yeah, the cloak from Tora.}}"

Poppi thought more, "But, who spread rumors?"

Vandham: "From what I hear, it's some... fancy-pants Nopon **merchant**."

"A Nopon merchant...?" Who can it be? Rex was thinking hard about it. 

While he was going through the list of those he'd traded with before, the girl they saved went up to Vandham and called out, "Excuse me, Mister Vandham?"

"**Uh?** Oh! **Well, if it isn't Iona!** You grew a fair **bit!** How's Grandpa Cole doing?"

She dropped her head, and he read it, "Ah... Not too good, then."

"Who's this?" asked Rex. 

"Huh? Ah, this is Iona. **That old friend of mine** takes care of her."

Pyra walked up to her, bent lower to her level to look if she's hurt or not, and look to her face down to up, greeted, "Hi, Iona. Great to meet you!"

![Iona and Pyra](images/119_iona_and_pyra.jpg)

Vandham urged, "**C'mon!** Let's beat it before those *soldiers* show up."

---

"Hmmm." The group was led outside a building that looked public. Outside the building was some drawings lining the walls, and a mannequin figure looking towards the building was placed in front of the door. 

Dromarch asked, "Is this... some kind of theater?"

Vandham acknowledged, "**Yup**, it's a theater, all right. The guy we're here for leads the troupe here."

Rex: "Ahhhhh. Actors, eh."

"And right now... they're in a middle of a show... _Well? Wanna take a quick peek?_"

Dromarch read the title, "'The Heroic Adventures of Addam.' Might be interesting." 

Pyra was awestruck. The name she hadn't heard for far too long. Addam... brings back memories...

"I've never been to the theatre before!" shared Rex.

"Neither has Tora!" as he bounced up and down. 

"_Let's do it!_ Nice and quiet though. Looks like it's pretty _packed today._"

"OK!"

"Mehmeh!" And they already entered. Despite memories and thoughts, she moved like a zombie, urged by the group, into. Wonder what memories she'll recall. 

---

"And I saw at _that time_, that **the powers of darkness had engulfed**, almost everything!" narrated the guy on the stage. "**People**, and Titans alike were **draaaaawn** into the abyssal **vortex**!"

![Theater](images/120_theater.jpg)

He continued, "The apocalypse was upon us! **The end was niiiigh!** _But then!_ Despite the wounds alllllll over his body, the **great Addam stood...**" 

The actor that acted as Addam, wearing some shiny helmets and armor, walked up the ship, raised his hand up, and shouted, "**O Architect! Grant me power!**" And he raised his sword into the air. "Power to banish the dark! Power, to illuminate the world!"

A moment of silence and many abominable creatures with red eyes grew below the ship, looking up to swallow him with the whole ship. The darkness had spread far, contaminated except for the last land he was to defend against. Addam jumped from above the deck to the 'ocean' floor below, raised his sword, and faced the abominable creatures alone.

![Abominable creatures fighting Addam](images/121_abominable_creatures.jpg)

Then, as if the Architect had heard his plead, brought down an angel with light. Addam, seeing his wish fulfilled, faced it like welcoming a holy saint, "Lo! Loyal servant of the Architect! The Aegis! **O Aegis! Bless me with your power! Bring light upon the world!**"

The angel, listening to his wishes, raised her hand and threw some paper scraps that fluttered down, and the crown above her head shone bright red. Fire grown below the abominable creatures, burning them to ashes. 

![The Aegis released her power](images/122_the_aegis_power.jpg)

"Thus, they defeated the darkness," continued the narrator. "_But at a **terrrrrrrible** price!_ **Three great continents, sank beneath the sea of clouds** forever."

In front of a door, Addam stood before the Aegis, laying flat on the ground. He walked towards it, spoke, "Servant of the Architect! By thy power, **the world is saved!** For the gift you have granted us, we are eternally grateful. I shall spread thy legend, far and wide! May your name live on, **for eternity!**" And he laid down and princess-carried her, walked through the doors behind.  The curtain thus lowers. 

![The end of Addam and the Aegis's story](images/123_the_end_of_addam_story.jpg)

Claps sounded. All except Pyra, sitting there, deep in memories. Rex noticed, but didn't disturb her. 

---

Exiting the theater, Nia called Rex quietly, "_Hey!_" He turned around before she continued, "_Kind of awkward, right?_"

"What was awkward?"

"I mean, that play... it was **about** Pyra. Must have been... kinda bizarre for her, eh?"

"I dunno... I guess?"

"May-be, _you should go and make it right._" And she walked away while he was trying to understand what she meant. 

"**Make it right? How?**"

"_Idiot. Figure it out yourself!_"

"**Huh? What am I supposed to-?**" Can't talk more. She was coming from behind. Put me on my feet. "Errrr... Ummm... So the theater..."

"**Wasn't it in-credible?!!!**" she exclaimed with huge excitement, at least on the surface. "**They had the cloth moving, just like real clouds!** How do... you think they did that?"

Now his mind can't turn around that quickly. "**HUH?...** Ah... Yeah! The clouds were pretty cool. They were so... **cloudy**?"

Gramps can't take it anymore, jumped up from Rex's helmet, and BANG him hard on his coconut head. 

"**OW!**"

Gramps quietly asked, "_What are you saying, bonehead?_"

"**There's no need for that!** I don't know what to say in a situation like this!" Looking back at her, she was back in reminiscence, not listening to what he'd replied, nor to what drama Gramps and Rex were having. 

![Pyra in deep thoughts](images/124_pyra_in_deep_thoughts.jpg)

---

At the back of the theater, there's a dark room with drawings and lots of objects; their silhouette carved in a room barely lit by one tiny ether lamp illuminating warmth on the table. Vandham entered with the others, greeted, "**Comin' in, old fella!** Crikey! **Still collecting the junk, are ya?**"

"_Watch it, you bruiser!_ Don't make fun of a mannnn's hobbies!" The old fella was wearing a cloak covering his face. 

![Cole](images/125_old_man.jpg)

"**Some greeting** for your old **comrade**!"

"Comrade?" Nia picked up the word. 

He explained, "Yeah, I was a freelancer before the firm got going. Believe it or not, me and this old fella tore up a good few **battlefields** in our day."

"We sure did. And thanks to that **bleeding** heart of yours, we almost never got *paid*!"

"**HUHAHAHAHAHAH!!! Says the guy in the theater troupe! You can't be** raking in much dough **either**!"

"Hmph. Well, what can I do for you, friend?"

"Cole, you're old, ain't ya? Old enough to know... **how to cross over** to the World Tree... _Get to Elysium, I mean._"

"Elysium? But why? W-w-why would you _want to go there?_" And he eyed the group until he picked her out of the crowd. His tone changed for the suppressed excitement, "_That Core Crystal! You... You're... So the Aegis is back amongst us... Who is your Driver?_"

"**I am.**"

"You? **But you're... so young...**"

Vandham urged, "**How about it, old man?** _Do you know the way or not?_"

"Hmmm... I dare say if you've trekked all the way here to ask me, you've already tried **going** yourselves?"

Rex acknowledged, "**Yeah**... But we couldn't make it."

"**No wonder.** No one can get to the tree, while that **thing's** guarding the way there. _It won't let anyone past._ But... **a long time ago, there was a man**... who went up the tree. Met the Architect, too."

"There was...? **Really?**"

"Yeaaaah. I'll wager anything, he's got an idea how to get there again. You should try asking him."

"**Uh who was it?**"

"Engh... Hmph."

"**Please, tell us!** I've got to get to Elysium, no **matter** the cost!"

"Well, I can tell you. But first, I'd like to have a word with her, if I may. With- the- Aegis, I mean."

"**With Pyra?**" He turned to look at her. 

"**Of course!**" she agreed. 

"Please, through here." he led her to a secret room behind. 

---

"**Mister Cole, right? You wrote that play, didn't you?**"

"I- hope it didn't stir up any... painful memories..."

"**N-nooo... Some of them are..**. good memories."

"Heh. You know, you're not very convincing. I'm sorry, I... really am. I **just** wanted people... to know about that time. Show people how we were back in those days... **Really**, get it across to them... Will you be, using it again? That **power**..."

"I don't know yet."

"I just don't know... if this world can **take** it a second time."

"I know that. _I'd never use it if there was another way._ This is what I- hope for. _But..._" Her head dropped. She could not predict the future. 

"That man's the only one who knows how to get to where you're going. Do you think you can make it to him? I just wanted to make sure."

"**We can.** I mean, it's my destiny." she replied boldly, and convinced herself. 

"Yeah... That boy, who's with you..."

"His name's Rex. He's a good person. With a kind heart."

"**Reminds** me of a, certain someone..."

"Mm." she agreed.{{footnote: Addam.}}

"OK then. I'll... help you out."

"Thank you... Minoth!"

"**Minoth... I'd almost forgotten** that name..."

---

Back to the room with the others, Cole: "**Now then,** _mmm_... **wheeeere** did it get to...? Uhurgh ahargh!"

Seeing him coughed like his lungs was to fall out any moments, Iona ran up full of worries, "**Grandpa!**"

"*Old man! You OK?*" The others were equally concerned.

While resisting his cough, he answered, "**I'm... fine... uhurgh ahargh... I'll be... pfth... fine in a second...** uhurgh **Seriously, uhum uhurgh... don't mind me...**"

"Nah, we'd better call it _a day, old timer._"

"Hurggghhh..." Rex felt slightly disappointed, but it looked like they had to, till he at least recovered a bit. 

Vandham: "I'm sorry, fella."

While he was still fighting his cough, "**Yeah, uhurgh OK. uhurgh.** But come back again tomorrow, will ya? There's something I- want to give you. **UHURGHHH UHURHGH ARGH!!**"

Vandham urged, "Come on. I know a place we can rest." Rex looked back at Old Cole once more before leaving. 

---

At Cole's place, on the scroll on the table placed a weapon, an assassin blade. He sat there relaxing. He had been expecting him. "Well, I'll be... It's just **one blast from the past** after another today." He turned around and faced Malos and Akhos.

Malos: "**You probably guessed**, but we're not here for a reunion."

"Just as well. **The Aegis's** gone already. _How disappointing for you, 'comrade'._"

"Huhuh! _Still an asshole._"

Akhos: "Despite the years taking their toll. **I'll wager** all the doctors in this town are **quacks**, and all the Blades are **blunt**. Obrona and I... **We could- fix that** stagnant ether flow with a minimum of bother. **What do you say?** You could still have a lot of good **years ahead of you!**" Behind the door, Iona was eavesdropping. Of course they'd noticed, but who cares? "I mean, I won't deny there'd be a certain quid pro quo involved. But old man, _just think of the benefits!_ Come, _can't you lend us your expertise here? Do so_, and you could live for a loooong, looooong time."

"**You know**, _friend_, **I'm not as attached** to my life as I used to be. Maybe I've had enough!" He turned around, rejected.

"Your little lost souls will be simply inconsolable."

"**The kids?** No, they're strong."

"Argh. **This is becoming a farce**. A horrendously clichéd one at that! Break a leg!" Malos and he turned around and leave the room. 

He looked down at the assassin knife on the table, in deep thoughts. 

![The Assassin's Blade](images/126_his_weapon.jpg)

---

Outside the theater, Akhos stopped in his track. Malos questioned, "Huh? What's that?"

Akhos turned around, called out, "**Hey, don't be shy.** _You heard everything we said, didn't you?_"

Iota was hiding behind the wooden beams as Akhos and Malos turned their attention to her. She walked out towards them, full of worries, questioned, "_Can you... Can you really help, Grandpa?_"

"**Why of course!**" He walked closer to her, continued, "_We can help._ That is, _if you can help **us**. Can you do that, for your grandfather?_"

---

At their lodge, Pyra and Nia were far asleep in the ladies' room. In her dream, Pyra was brought back to Elysium. The unending lush and green, the constant ruffling wind, the clear blue sky, the bell that chimes. She thought she was alone, but no. Behind her was the tree, and someone stood below. 

"This is... You... can't come here."

Malos: "Hmph. Charming! So **you're** making the rules now, huh?"

She turned and faced him, "You didn't come here to talk about _the old days,_ did you?"

"Huh! We've snatched Minoth's little brat."

"No!"

"Meet me at the place of your awakening. You remember it, right?"

"_Hurgh!_"

"Ohhh, and come alone."

---

Nia opened her eyes and looked to her left. Pyra was no longer on her bed. Her brain's not working at its full, she could only guessed, "_In the loo? I guess?_" Then closed her eyes, back to sleep. 

Suddenly, the furious continuous bang on the door shocked her out of bed as she jumped up. 

A few moments later, everyone ran out of their room, found Cole accompanied by another guy. Vandham wondered, "**Old man! What happened?!**"

"Iona... She's gone! It... **must've been them!**"

Rex: "Who's 'them'?"

"After you went, Malos... and some other guy, paid me a visit."

"Malos was here?"

"Who was the other guy?" asked Nia.

"Didn't catch his name. But he had red glasses."

"That's Akhos! But... what would he want with Iona?"

Rex had other concerns, "Wait! **Nia**! Where's Pyra?"

"S-s-she wasn't- there when I woke up. **What? No one's seen her?**"

"Pyra... Maybe she **realized** what was going on with Iona?"

Cole: "Well, knowing those two, it's not unthinkable."

Nia: "_That girl!_ Trying to save her on her own?"

Rex was more concerned with "**Where's she gone? Didn't she leave a note?**"

"**No. I'd have noticed!**"

"I-I know where... I think it could be- Olethro Ruins."

Rex: "Olethro Ruins?"

"It's where Addam led his army of resistance from. Five hundred years ago. It's the place where the Aegis woke up, too."

"Huh!"

"It must be that Malos is trying to **lure her down there! I'm sure of it!**"

"**Cole! Tell us how to get there!**"

"It's at the **top of the Great Stairway.**"

"**Vandham!**"

"**Hey! Fella! Take care of this old man for us.**"

The guy accompanying Cole answered, "**Y-yes!**"

Rex urged, "Let's move! If we go now, maybe we can catch up to her!"
