# Postscript

- The constant desolation in Pyra's background. 
- The background does not lack funny moments, light feeling, amidst trying to save Nia's seriousness. Unlike XC3, which had a more solid background of desolation -- the world's state. 
- 7 years ago, one only remembers the part when Pyra spoke to Rex across the bridge, probably because one was destitute (desolate?) at the time. Now, seeing it anew, one could see also the happy side of their time invested together, the little moments one felt jealous of and wished one was in his place. Mortimer Adler used to say, a Great Book, rereading it at different stages of life, you get different insights. Perhaps Xenoblade 2 is itself great, letting one feel things one don't before. So great one cannot fully translate the feelings one wanted to share. Even the music, one only hear those sad ones before, didn't even realize those happy ones exist, hiding between those plentiful 'boring' background musics. 
- One mentioned about XC3 carving deep on one but one XC1 or XC2; one do had to apologize; one'd fallen into the trap of availability bias, even when one know it exists, but one never questioned oneself. Second, as discussed, because one only see the sad stages of XC2, one'd forgotten about the little happy moments which now carves deeper insights on one that didn't before. 
- The difference between this story and XC3 is that, despite being jailed and Pyra was away, he wasn't as sad as Noah was when Mio was next door. Sure, they had the same anger; but the background were different. He is a child, _he_ is an adult. Well, sort of, though Rex lived longer than him. And the environment isn't depressed here. Rex _is_ an optimist, remember?
