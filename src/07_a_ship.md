# We need a ship

===

Deep beneath the Cloud Sea, where blackness ensued year long, a submarine cruised with the flow. A mechanism opened and accepted the Monoceros, an internal pool of water it parked along. 

"Welcome home, Jin." Malos and his blade trailed behind. 

"Hey, Akhos."

![Akhos](images/067_akhos.jpg)

"I hear the Aegis awakened. Nasty shock for you? Orrrrrr, was it?" said the blue armor guy wearing a pair of red-framed goggles with dark, short hair, wielding twin katanas stuck to both side of his waist. Pushing up his spectacles, a sign of 'genius', he continued, "**Of course**, my script showed how _everything_ would play out from the start."

"Sure, you say that once it's all over and done with. It's eaaaasy to act smug when hindsight's on your sight!" A blade entered the scene from a hatch above. 

"Shut your mouth, Obrona."

"I'm shaking to my core!" She floated around Akhos as she teased him. 

![Obrona and Akhos](images/068_obrona_and_akhos.jpg)

Malos had no time for play play, asked, "Where are the other two?"

"Mikhail's inspecting the Ardainian 'factory'... And my beloved sister is out hunting, as always. **I'm sure she'll** have found plenty of Drivers to chew up and spit out by now."

"She likes to hunt, all right. Not sure we can **use** all of those Core Crystals though..."

Jin changed the topic, "Do we know where the Aegis is right now?"

"Have no fear, Jin! **Of course we know** her whereabouts! Obrona?"

"Yeah, yeah..." The light particles gathered on her hands and distribute out, showing a map of the Cloud Sea and the various Titans' locations. 

"Hm! It seems they're currently traveling away from the urban area of Gormott."

Malos was surprised, "Leaving the town? But there's nothing out that way..."

"Perhaps they're on their way out of Gormott itself," hypothesized Akhos. "**Oh**, and..."

"What?" asked Jin.

"It seems a certain... _shipment_, has set out."

Malos noted, "The Core Crystal heading to Indol for cleansing, huh? How pious of them. Shall we handle them?"

Jin: "I can deal with that myself. You concentrate on the Aegis."

Akhos, excitedly, "Understood. _Well, I am looking forward to clapping eyes on the Aegis._" Then changed topic, "By the way, what of Nia?"

"You know where she is?"

"Yes. Look. This dot here. Without a doubt, this is Dromarch's wavelength." That's the blue dot. "It _seems_ they're traveling together, with the Aegis."

![GPS on Akhos's map](images/069_akhos_gps.jpg)

"**With the Aegis?**" Malos eyed sideways, to see what reaction Jin had for the girl. "Huh. Do as you see fit."

"Understood. _You don't_, need to ask me twice." replied Akhos. Jin already turned around and leave. 

Malos announced, "Right then. We're gonna take the Monoceros."

Jin: "Hm. As you wish." Not looking back as he leave. 

"**Hey!**" Malos called him on his track. "**Don't**, do anything too reckless." As if he needed reminding, he continued leaving the room, not caring to reply. Obrona dissipated the map, and leave the room with the rest on the other side.

Morning rise and Tora was asking, "What is that?"

"A Cloud Sea compass." explained Rex. "A must-have for salvagers. It's sort of a map of the Cloud Sea. If you do this... And this... What's the- date today?" He meddled with the compass a moment and asked Pyra. 

"Um... Amathatober 5th, 4058." Took a while for her to think. 

"**OK!** So now we put the **date in... See?**" He handed it out for them to view. 

Tora was impressed, "Hoh, this is **very** clever!"

Gramps noted, "Looks like Gormott- is the closest country to the World Tree right now."

Rex: "All we need is a ship."

Dromarch: "The army has... every ship in town in its grip."

Nia: "Ugh... We're kinda stuck."

Pyra don't have extra info either, "Seems that way."

Gramps: "Sorry, I'm no use now..."

Rex: "I know, I know. But I'm all out of ideas..."

"Rex-Rex need ship? Hoh, **Tora have good idea!**"

"You do?"

"There is ship builder living at Gormott Titan's bum-bum! Old- friend- of Tora's Grampypon. He called- Umon! _Maybe he help_ **if we tell him what's what!**"

Sounds like a plan. Rex agreed, "Sure, it's worth a shot! **Let's get going.**"

---

"**Helloooo! Umon! Uuuumon?!** Where is Umon?" Riku immediately shouted for attention entering the building, impatiently. 

![Umon](images/073_umon.jpg)

Umon did hear, "Who is that? Who is noisy while I do my work? Tora! This big surprise!" He was talking before he eyed the Nopon calling for him. 

"Long time no see, Unclepon!"

"Yes! L-long time! About one whole year?"

"**Yes**, about that!"

"You became **very big** in one year, Tora!"

"Yes, Tora not littlepon anymore."

"And- Tora have lots of sidekicks!"

"Rex-Rex and friends are not Tora's sidekicks! They are **real friends**, Umon!" Turning to him, he introduced, "Rex-Rex! Meet Unclepon Umon! He did great research with Grampypon! He is great builder of ships!"

"Hello!" Rex called out. 

Pyra: "Greetings!"

Dromarch: "At your service."

Umon, scratching his head, "I see. Tora's friends! **Tora has lots of friends. Very good!** Tora has become fine biggipon."

"Eheheheh..." he tried to cover his face from blushing. 

Getting to the topic of the day, Umon asked, "Well, Tora. Did you need Umon's help for something?"

"Well, we wanted to borrow a ship. From Unclepon Umon!"

"A ship? But there are lots of ships in Torigoth! Why hike all the way to bum-bum to see me?"

"_Oh... erm uh uh..._ **well...**"

Umon hypothesized, "Tora run out of gold, hmmm?"

"Umm... Yes! Tora spend all the gold on artificial Blade! Tora flat broke, like penniless pancake hmhmhm. I wanted to go on a little... boaty-jaunt to, ah... nearby place. But **no money to go on boat!**"

Nia is very suspicious with the lying, said to Rex, "_Hmph. I hope Tora can keep track of all  of these fibs he's telling..._"

"There's no other option. We can hardly tell him what happened in Torigoth, can we?"

"Y-yeah, I guess you're right..."

"So long as we get a boat out of this..."

Meanwhile, Umon was considering his request, "Artificial Blade, eh? Was this what Tora's Grampypon was working on?"

"My name is Poppi. Pleased to meet Unclepon."

"**Yeeeeeessss! This it! This pretty mighty! Tora take after Grampypon indeed!** Ohhh, well... **How can I refuse Tora now?** Tora may use Umon's ship, but _there is problem._"

"Wh-what is problem?"

The ship miraculously parked just to his right. He looked at it, answered, "You seeeee, ship- not quite ready- just yet. **Not much left to do**! _But work stop, because no- building parts._"

![Umon's ship](images/074_umons_ship.jpg)

"That's the only problem?" asked Rex.

"**Correct!** But that is **big** problem. Big like sea or mountain."

"You mean, all you need is some parts, then you can finish the ship?"

"It- just as you say, friend."

"Sooo, if we go and find the parts, then- you'll..."

"**Of course! I make ship ready. Then you borrow!**"

"**Thank you! Come on everyone, let's go!**"

Tora: "**Yay!** Let's go find ship ingredients!" They haven't even listened to Umon what ingredients he needed and they left already. 

---

"So now we borrow Unclepon's boat!"

Rex: "Thanks, Umon! We owe you!"

"**Indeed! Enjoy your boaty-jaunt!**" And the ship departed the dock. 

---

A plain white clouds they floated within, with no other island in its vicinity. Yet their destination was clear. Straight for it. Nearer and nearer they gets, the bark so wide and huge. 

"So that's the World Tree..." Rex was at the helm as he exclaimed. 

![World Tree Close Up](images/075_world_tree_close_up.jpg)

Nia: "Wow, I've never seen it so close before..."

"Me neither, _to tell you the truth. But it's just as awesome as I'd hoped._"

"The current's really strong... Fall in that, and you're a goner." At the edge of where the tree was planted, a great waterfall pushed water into the void. 

![The Void around the World Tree](images/076_around_the_world_tree.jpg)

"It's great that we made it this far... But how do we get over there? Any ideas? Pyra?" 

Her mind was fixated on getting so close home she was awestruck for a moment. "We..."

"Huh?"

"**Rex! We need to leave! We can't stay here!**"

"What, why? What are you talking about, Pyra?" 

Seemingly she had sensed something early. The water below them started shaking, and the windshield in front of them started splashing water. A purple drill-like snaky monster poked its head from below the water, its target them. The ship shook as its shadow loomed over them. 

![Ophion](images/077_ophion.jpg)

"**Ophion!**" Pyra called out. But it didn't remember her. 

Rex: "**Ophi-who?!**"

"**QUICK!!!**" 

"**Uh? Gotcha!**" He steered the steering full right. The Titan pedaling the ship swam for its dear life. 

Meanwhile, Pyra was facing Ophion, trying to communicate with it as it was catching up with them, "Ophion! Stop this! What's wrong? Can't you hear me? It can't be!" 

Its giant tell slashed at the water, sending waves at the escaping ship. The ship braced for impact against the rough waves. But it was too slow for the water snake. Rex had to time it, in case it attacked. But looking back, he saw Ophion turning around, not leaving the vicinity of the World Tree. He had now time to ask, "What was that? Thought we were done for! Huh?"

Escaping the mouth of Ophion had not let them escape danger. The water was again shaking another time as they realized the ship was aiming for a giant Titan's mouth that just emerged from the water not long ago. Sucking in water, their ship had no escape. 

![Giant Titan mouth](images/078_giant_titan_mouth.jpg)

"**Is that...**"

Gramps recognized, "**Uraya's Titan!**"

"**This is NOT GOOD!!! AGH! HERE IT COMES!!!**" Along the tide their ship ride the currents, straight for the Titan's mouth. 

"**AGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!**" And all shouted for the end of their dear life. The Titan swallowed them and sink back into the water. 

---

"**ARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!**" As they crashed into the internal organs of the Uraya Titan. 

"Ogh Agh..." Rex stood up. There were lights seemingly from something glowing within the Titan, but it's not bright enough to shine their way. Luckily, for a salvager, he brought lights always with him. Turning it on and clicking it on the port on his belly, he shouted, "**Pyra! Anybody!**"

Pyra's voice sounded, "**Ugh... I- I'm here.**" The edge of her cloth glowing in the dark; he saw her standing up, walking towards him. 

"You hurt?"

"No, I-I'm... fine."

"Ach, ow..." Nia was meanwhile getting up in the dark. 

"**Meeeehhh...**" and Tora. All gathered around. 

Rex: "Looks like we're all OK..."

Gramps: "Except for the fact that we now find ourselves in the belly of the beast.{{footnote: And how they're to tell Unclepon Umon that his ship is forever gone.}}{{footnote: And luckily, no acid inside the belly.}}"

"**The beastie's belly?**"

"This is the inside of the Urayan Titan."

"Meh meh!"

"Look."

"Tora think this not nice place."

Rex: "Is that how we're gonna end up?"

Nia: "Hey, Rex! Don't jinx us!"

Dromarch: "Everyone. Shouldn't we try to get out of here? If I recall, the Urayans live towards the beast's back. There **must** be a way, up there."

"Yeah. Can't hang around here, for sure."

Poppi looked to a direction, signaled, "Over there!"

"Huh?"

"Poppi see something over there. Someone coming this way."

"For real? Maybe you're just seeing things."

"Poppi is certain. Something is flickering over there."

Rex: "Flickering... you say? Some kind of ghost maybe?" He directed his torchlight towards that direction. Lush green grass grown inside the belly of the Titan despite the lack of light for photosynthesis, a mysterious phenomena. 

Nia: "_S-shut up!_ There's no such thing!"

"Nia, you're not scared, surely!" He teased. 

"D-don't talk nonsense, Rex! _I'm not a kid!_"

"You're **scared! At last. Something Nia's scared of.**"

"Just. You. Watch... _Hey! Where's... Pyra?_"

"What?" 

She looked around before announcing, "Pyra's missing."

He pointed his torchlight where he saw Pyra just now. No longer there. "Uh... But she was right here. Pyra? **Pyra?!**"

"**Hey, what's up?**" A fire she lit from her hand burnt behind Rex as she greeted. 

"**URRRRGGGHHHH!!!**" Scared him out of his gut. "**H-Hey, what's the big idea?! Don't wander off like that!**"

"Nothing, really. I was just... taking- a look around. What's the matter?"

"Heh heheheh..." Now Nia had something to laugh back at Rex. Right back at ya! 

"What's so funny?"

"_Oh, nothing..._"

"Ngh... Titan's foot!"

Pyra made a larger flame that shone the environment brighter than his torchlight could. 

![Fire ball](images/079_lighting_up_the_surrounding.jpg)

Gramps was delighted, "Oh! Things are looking brighter already."

"Poppi can help too." She looked up and two beams of light shone into the air. As if that helped a lot...

![Poppi's light](images/080_poppis_light.jpg)

"Now even more brighter!" exclaimed Tora.

Nia: "You two are certainly earning your keep. Huh, I wish I could say the same for old **Dromarch** here!"

"Apologies, my lady."

Rex: "See? Not so scary when you can actually see. Let's find the exit!"

"**YEAH!!!**" all chanted.
