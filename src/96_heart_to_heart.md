# Heart to Heart

### The Real Gramps

At the place where they were first washed up, Pyra, Rex, Gramps, Nia, Tora, and Poppi overlooked the foggy distant scene. 

![Where Rex and Pyra's adventure began](images/070_gormott_washed_up_place.jpg)

"We're back here. This is where my whole adventure with Rex really began." exclaimed Pyra. 

Nia: "Oh, right. This must be the spot here you and Rex washed up."

Rex added: "Though we only made it here thanks to Gramps's efforts."

Gramps: "And those efforts are the reason I'm like this now..." Talk about being in larvae form. 

Nia at least felt gratitude, reasoned, "Well, if you stayed that big you couldn't exactly travel with us. I'd say you're just right!"

"If I was my old self, I'd be able to carry you anywhere! Well, anywhere within reason. The World Tree would be pushing it."

"**Amazing!**" exclaimed Tora. "So how long it take you to get to Argentum from here?"

"At the current separation, let's see... About 10 days travel."

"That long?!" Nia couldn't believe what she'd just heard. 

"'You'd do it faster than that or you'd taste the whip!' is what I'm hearing."

"Of courseeee that's not what I mean. _But that_'s like 3 or 4 days by boat."

"My apologies. I'm not as young as I used to be."

Poppi don't understand, "What is point of worrying now Gramps not big any more?"

"True enough. That old body... is a thing of the past!"

Pyra walked up closer, commented, "Well I think you are _adorable like this._ I like it."

"Well, _that's very kind of you, Pyra._"

"Are you blushing, oldster?" Nia tried to look closer. 

He immediately blurt out, changed the topic as rapidly as he could, "**Tell me, Rex. Do you ever wish I was in my old form?**"

> Choose: "I liked it better when you were big."  
> or "I think you're better like this."

> (**Choice 1:**) "I liked it better when you were big."

"Oh, is that so? I suppose you found me very useful as a Titan."

"Huh?"

"I provided a home... carried you from place to place... Not to mention the salvaging crane{{footnote: That anchor.}} stuck you-know-where."

Scratching his head, "That's not really what I meant! It's just that you were so **big and dependable**. Like a dad, or, well, a real grandpa. **Besides**, I knew you in that form for most of my life. Everyone else only really knows you like this, but I'm not used to it."

Pyra: "Rex has a point. The time when I knew you before, Azurda, is very faint in my mind. This is the _Gramps_ I'm used to."

"Tora cannot imagine big Gramps!"

"Poppi never seen big Gramps, so **also cannot** picture."

Rex: "Right? That's what I thought. It's all about what you're used to."

Gramps, thinking, "Hmm... I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Though I know you're really just **pining** for the days when you could travel in comfort on my back."

> (**Choice 2:**) "I think you're better like this."

"**Oho! You prefer me this way?**" The excitement in his voice don't subside. 

"It's cool to have you riding on MY back for a change! **Just hearing** you **encourage me** from behind reeeeeaaaaally sets my heart at ease. And when you were big, we couldn't just, y'know, hang out or- walk together. I like being able to _stay close._"

"I see, I see..."

Pyra noticed, "You look rather pleased, Azurda."

"If I were to be honest, Rex's helmet is a little cramped. Not to mention the jolting and bumping and bouncing around. It's enough to make me lose my lunch at times. But... hearing Rex- say that, for the first time it made me- think that perhaps this- was- actually a good thing."

"I'm sorry about the jolting. Looks like I've gotta get used to this situation too."

"That's all right, Rex. I'll keep the words of encouragement coming! I shall endeavor to become... ever more reliable."

"Ummm... Actually, if you're planning on nagging me constantly, maybe I'll **pass**..."

Nia agreed, "_Yeah_, I wouldn't want to have Dromarch's nagging voice in my ear all the time, either..."

Gramps: "**Cheeky sods!**"

### Ardainian Technology

On the 1st Floor (American 2nd Floor) of Mòrag's ship, Rex, Tora, Poppi, Nia, Gramps, they were looking at the technology at the control room.{{footnote: Pyra and Dromarch wasn't there, probably because they don't have speeches, so the creator don't see a need to put them in. Though one personally would disagree; as in putting them in even if they don't have something to say would fare better in one's opinion. Plus, Gramps is inside but not speaking, sitting in Rex's helmet as decorative.}}

![Inside Mòrag's ship control room](images/071_morag_ship.jpg)

Nia noted, "The inside of a Titan battleship is way different from the Monoceros, huh..."

Poppi raised her hand and questioned, "What is Monoceros?"

"Rex, you saw it, right? Moored at a pier back in Goldmouth? Jin and co.'s black boat."{{footnote: That's the Argentum trade guild, when he first visited and noticed it in Chapter 1.}}

"**Aaaahhh**, that really impressive one! It runs without being hooked up to a Titan, right?"

"I'm no expert, but... yeah, looked like it."

Tora: "Sound **awesome! Tora want to see too!**"

Rex: "You won't get the chance, unless we see those Torna guys again."

"Meh, mehmeh, meh! Tora change mind. No need to see." The fear of getting attacked exceeded his curiosity. 

"Masterpon change mind at drop of hat..."

Rex turned their attention back to the panels before them, "Well, the Monoceros was pretty sweet, but this is nothing to scoff at either!"

Nia: "For sure. It's full of things I've never seen before."

Tora: "Ah! That's because this vessel is result of **latest** breakthroughs in **Ardainian tech!** Regular folk never so much as set foot on board!"

"You say, breakthroughs in technology, but what you mean... is salvaged stuff, right?"

Rex answered, "Ummm, not exclusively. I see lots of homegrown improvements as well. **Like this,** see? Whatever they've stuffed in here, it's been messed with so much, I can't tell what it was to start with."

Tora seemed to know, "That control panel. It transmit signal to Titan nerves. By running cables to different parts of Titan from here, can control signal flow much more better."

"**Whaaaattt??? That's amazing!**"

"And this cable itself have 2.4 time the speed and 12 time the capacity of previous iteration. In other words, it on whole other level to stuff other countries use!"

"Huuuuhh! So if they put this in a smaller Titan vessel, it would work **even better!**" The sense of excitement in his voice; but who was he thinking about? 

"**Pin-pon! Correct!**"

Nia, speaking to Poppi, "Grrrrh! They seem to be having fun, but it's all gibberish to me. Poppi, what do you think?"

> Choose: "That not even so bad..."  
> or "Why Masterpon act so proud?"

> (**Choice 1:**) "That not even so bad..."

"Oh really?"

"Poppi have access to **much varied** information. Considering interests of Masterpon, technology info is especially rich. So for Poppi is not issue, following conversation in question. Moreover, if necessary, Poppi could out-geek Masterpon if Poppi try." Her hands and feet jumped and juggled about a lot as she excitedly answered. 

"R-right, OK..." So she was the only one... "I'm sorry I doubted you."

"No worry, Nia. Poppi can also hold conversation on favorite bug dishes of Nia."

"You're too kind... I- should point out though, it's not **bugs** I like, but **fish.**"

"Meh? Poppi apologize. Poppi update her database now. Masterpon not always fastidious in data entry, so mistakes happen."

Heh heh heh, found the culprit, she shouted out, "**Tora! I like bugs now, do I?**" The look in her eyes. 

His fur stood on ends, "Meh-meh! Tora suddenly feel very unsafe. Rex-Rex, we should move on. If we stay here, something **bad** bound to happen!"

"Like what?" asked Rex, not yet sensing the situation. 

"**No time to waste, we go!**"

> (**Choice 2:**) "Why Masterpon act so proud?"

"**Ho-hoo! Tora very glad you ask!** That because- tech used in this Titan battleship is same as what Poppi's muscles and drivetrain use!"

"**Poppi is surprised!**"

"**But however** though! Ones that Poppi use are even more improved than these here!"

"**Yet more surprise!**"

Nia hypothesized, "Are you saying you stole the tech from Mor Ardain?"

Rex: "C'mon, Tora... Is that what you call sporting behavior?"

"**Tora take calculated risk in service to cause of scientific advancement...**" He reasoned to himself. "As result, not even Ardainian scientists capable of reverse-engineer Poppi systems! **So, no worries there!**"

Poppi's head dropped to ground, "Upon learning secret of Poppi's birth, Poppi feel sense of unease..."

"Ugh **E-everything fine!...** _Probably!_ **Now Rex-Rex! No time for chit-chat. Let's get going!**"

### Poppi's Unending Curiosity

At Melnath's Shoulder, overlooking the Cloud Sea on the plains outside Torigoth, Poppi asked, "Masterpon, Poppi have question."

![Melnath's Shoulder](images/072_melnath_shoulder.jpg)

"Pursuit of learning is **good thing**. Ask **anything** and Tora will answer!"

"Cloud Sea clearly visible from here. Height of Cloud Sea is different at different times. Why height change?"

"Meh-meh?! W-well, um..." Sweat started poring down Tora's face as he struggled with getting an explanation for her. Ah, scapegoat! With a cool tone, he said, "Tora let Rex-Rex answer that one!"

Poppi went to Rex and asked, "Rex, why cloud height change?"

"Well, let's see now... Maybe it's easier if you compare it to the clouds, in the sky. They come in all different shapes, right?"

"Some clouds very flat... Other clouds big and- fluffy!" noted Poppi.

"**Yeah, that's what I mean.** And the shape doesn't stay the same forever. The Cloud Sea is the same way. It's not always a flat surface, sometimes it gets... fluffed up. The height- and shape of it isn't constant. It's alwaaays changing. Not- **suddenly**, like the weather, but- gradually."

Gramps: "It more likely than not... to change overnight."

"**Yeah! That sounds about right!**"

"Very interesting."{{footnote: Even more interesting: how do you notice the height of the sea change when you're living in a boat? On land, you can see that the water cover more beaches at certain times, while cover less beaches at recede sea level; but if you're living on a Titan which water always reached the same level (unless you put up more weight or less weight so it had different levels), a floating object is probably constant to changing sea level, theoretically. One don't know practically, though.}}

"Oh, but it's only the Titans like this one, and the Mor Ardain Titan that affect the Cloud Sea's height. Ones like the Trade Guild Titan **Goldmouth** just float on the surface, so they don't affect it."{{footnote: So does this means Gormott and Mor Ardain titan don't float on the surface, but have their feet on the seabed, 'walking in water'?}}

"Makes lots of sense!"

"I guess that's about the extent of what I know."

"Very much thanks, Rex. Poppi learn a lot! Rex must know **lots** of things. **Poppi have even more questions to ask!**"

He jumped a step back, "Oh, really? I don't know if I can answer everything..."

Tora: "Poppi..."

> Choose: "Should not bother Rex-Rex too much!"  
> or "Try ask Dromarch instead!"

> (**Choice 1:**) "Should not bother Rex-Rex too much!"

"Hmm... OK then. Poppi leave questions there for now."

"Thanks, Tora." You saved my skin! "I know quite a lot about the Cloud Sea because of my salvaging **work**, but I'm not so hot on general knowledge. I probably wouldn't have been able to answer anything else..."

Pyra reassured him, "Don't worry, Rex. If you don't know the answer, there's always a chance that I will!"

"Thanks, Pyra!"

"And if even I don't know, we can still fall back on Azurda."

Gramps: "True enough. I've been around for quite a while{{footnote: Ahem, few hundred years of waking moments.}}, so I could most likely answer any questions Poppi might have. And there's Dromarch as well. _Between us, I'm sure we could find an answer to most questions._"

Rex: "You're not wrong there. If all of us work together, we can figure out pretty much anything!"

Pyra: "I guess it's not just battle where teamwork is important!"

"Yeah!"

> (**Choice 2:**) "Try ask **Dromarch** instead!"

Rex: "That's a good idea. I reckon Dromarch is more knowledgeable than I am."

"Ohhhh, you flatter me. I'm- no expert compared to our resident Titan."

Gramps: "Wha- Don't drag me into this!"

"I have no memories of the time, before I bonded with my lady, after all."

"That's no reason to throw me into the cooking pot! What am I supposed to say, if Poppi asks 'Where do babies come from?' or something like that?!"

"Mmmm... Tell her they are delivered by a flying Tirkin.{{footnote: a big-beak bird that wields Iron-age weaponry like spears and wear an armor.}}"

"That kind of quick thinking is why you're a better man for the job."

"Ah, you over-**estimate** me. **Still, if the mighty** TItan is not willing, I suppose, we will have to rely on, my lady, instead."

"Hooooooold it, Dromarch. I want nooooo part in this mess!"

Poppi, in the meantime, eavesdropping their conversation and passing the bucks, exclaimed, "Masterpon, Poppi think Poppi **already** learn something."

"Huh, learn what?"

"This what people mean when they talk about 'passing the buck'!"

### Blushy-Crushy

At the canteen (Plaza of Reprieve) at Garfont Village, where Vandham lived, Pyra exclaimed, "I made tea for everyone. Help yourself."

![At the canteen](images/088_pyra_tea.jpg)

Tora: "Oh, noooo. Pyra getting it **completely** wrong."

"Oh? Would you... rather have something else, Tora?"

"Oh no no, that not it ummm. Tora just think that if- _Pyra going to_- **do** maid job, Pyra should be more... _maidy._"

"_Maidy?_"

Nia complaint, "Tora. Pyra was kind enough to make tea. Can't you just be bloody grateful?"

"**Oh, Tora knowwwww that,** but, also... Strive for perfection is important goal! Tora feel- very- strongly about this! _Most important thing for maid is... um... Nopon word is, uh... 'blushy-crushy'._ **Pyra still quite- lacking in that area!**"

"I... I-I'm lacking? _But what_ on Alrest is 'blushy-crushy'?"

"It uh... what every man, looking for. If Pyra **master art** of blushy-crushy, then all men fall at Pyra's feet!"

"A-a-all men? Really?"

"Yes! Uh It is... known fact!"

Nia: "Listen, Pyra. There's no point paying attention to this little twerp." He must be wanting to fall to her feet himself. 

"But..."

They haven't yet argued, Tora already cut in, "Is Pyra interested in essence of maidiness?"

> Choose: "Yes I am!"  
> or "If you think Rex would like that..."

> (**Choice 1:**) "Yes, I am!"

Nia was terrified, "You cannot be serious!"

Tora was overjoyed, "**Good attitude!** Tora will teach maid art of **blushy-crushy!** Welcome Tora's maidiest assistant!"

"_How may I be of service, Masterpon? Tee-hee!_" Just the opening is already so maidy. 

Pyra was surprised, "P-Poppi?"

Nia: "What the hell happened to you? Is this some kinda malfunction?" Recall, when she wasn't there, what misprogramming Tora had gave her when she first start up. 

"_Poppi's Maidiest Mode has been activated. Tee-hee!_"

Tora: "**Hoho! Maidiest Poppi** will teach you all about essence of maid behavior."

Standing next to each other, Pyra watched Poppi, she started, "Blushy-crushy, is external magnification of love feelings inside heart. Poppi will teach magic way to magnify **love** feelings. **Chant with Poppi.**"

"O-OK!"

"**Cutey-cutey, lovely-lovely, blushy-crushy, tee-hee!**"

Nia was already not feeling right, warned, "Pyra, please do NOT tell me you're gonna..."

She wasn't listening, trying to replicate, "C-cutey-cutey? Lovely... lovely... Blushy... Crushy... Tee-hee!" Except hers was more bland than Poppi's. 

"**Whop**, there we go." Nia felt wanting to throw up at any moments. 

"**Nnnnn-Not quite! Copy Poppi... _exactly!_**" The judge determined. 

"Yes, coach!"

"Please, Pyra... Come back to us... While you still can!"

> (**Choice 2:**) "If you think Rex _would like_ that..."

"Rex-Rex is **boy**, so he definitely not immune to the... _charms of blushy-crushy._ It definitely worth Pyra's time to learn **essence** of maidiness."

"I see... **OK**, I'm ready! Tora, tell me what to do!" such straightforwardness. 

"Uh, Pyra?" Nia was sweating cold sweat. 

"Tora will now introduce assistant to help teach **essence of maidiness!**"

"**How may I be of service, Mr. Rex, sir? Tee-hee!**"

Pyra was surprised, "P-Poppi?"

Nia: "What is this, Tora, some kinda... malfunction?"

Poppi answered for her, "**Do not worry. This just 'Rex-Focused Blushy-Crushy Maximization Mode'. Have a good day _salvaging_, Mr. Rex, sir! Tee-hee-hee!**"

"**Mr.Rex... sir?**" Nia jumped on her feet. 

Pyra felt blushingly red, "S-s-so... this is... 'blushy-crushy'..."

"OK, Pyra, copy what Poppi say."

Side by side, Poppi started, "**Mr. Rex, sir, Poppi is** blushy-crushy **just for you.**"

Immediately she tried, quite blandly, her feeling of shame shot to max, "Mr. Rex... sir... Pyra- is... blushy-crushy... just for you?"

"**No no, no, no! Rex-Rex will never fall** at Pyra's feet with such **low level of blushy-crushy!** Try again, from top!"

Like the boss female manager whom shouted commands, she called out, "**Mr. Rex! Sir! Pyra** is blushy-crushy! **Just for you!**"

"_Not there yet!_"

Nia: "I... I give up. I can't watch this any more."

---

### Tora's Angst

At the stomach of Uraya, above Farlaine Central Pools, Tora exclaimed, "**Outstanding!** It thanks to Tora becoming Driver that Tora come to this place! Blades and Drivers **MOST BEST EVER!!!** Oh, that remind Tora! **Rex-Rex, Nia!** Tora need- _little_ consultation."

![Uraya Stomach](images/151_uraya_stomach.jpg)

Nia: "Uh, a consultation? With us?"

"Tora have **big** problem right now. Recently... Tora finally realized. Tora is..."

"Tora- is...?" urged Rex.

"Tora is not- _very useful in battle!_"

"Ugh!" "Oh!"

"Why friends silent?"

"Oh, uhhh... We're just a bit surprised." answered Rex.

Nia added, "I mean, I just never really took you for the self-assessing type."

"Org, _too cruel._"

"Naaaahhh, I mean, you fight **just fine**, Tora."

"Poppi deserve all the credit. She pass weapon... and do all the things so Tora can fight like **real Driver.** Tora sometimes think, if he remove program of Poppi, Poppi fighting- **alone**- _would be most efficient..._"

Nia was surprised, "**Seriously? Wow, you go girl!**"

"**That why Tora just feel like- small furry ball and chain!**"

Rex: "Well, errrr... I wouldn't go **that** far..."

"Anyway, Tora wonder if there any point to Tora **still** being Driver. Maybe it better for everyone if- **Tora retire** and assume supervisor duty on sideline?"

"Ohhhh, Tora! Nia, what do you think?"

> Choose: "Why did you want to be a Driver?"  
> or "What's the most important thing, for a Driver?"

> (**Choice 1:**) "Why did you want to be a Driver?"

He turned around and looked at the scene, reflecting his life, answered, "It not clear to Tora anymore... Starting with Grampypon, dearest wish of family was to **successfully create artificial Blade**. So, it natural that Tora start to wish it too!"

"Well, do you know **why** your grandad wanted to make an artificial Blade?"

"Surely it because..." He turned around and surprised the group with the most controversy reasoning, "**He want to be famous!**"

Rex: "That sounds like a lame reason..."

"**But** Nopon Driver is **rare** thing! Nopon who become Driver almost **sure** to become celebrity!"

"Was that your motivation as well, then?"

"Mmmmmeeeeehhhh... **Not** exactly. Tora want to be **like Rex-Rex!**"

"Like me?"

"At first, Tora simply yeaaaarn to be Driver, not- think- too much about it. But... _after me travel with Rex-Rex and friends_, he start to think different! Saving persons in need, facing all challenges... **Rex-Rex** is Tora's **idea** of **perfect Driver!**"

"It... feels kinda strange when you say that to my face..."

Nia wondered, "Rex, _a perfect Driver? I'm not convinced_. But it looks like you've got a clear goal in mind, Tora."

"**Hey, hold on!**"

Nia ignored him, continued, "Honestly, that's all you need! Tora, you should keep being a Driver. As- long- as you have goals to achieve, there's **no** reason for you to stop. And your Blade will help you in that. **Poppi shouldn't have to fight alone. You need** to be **right there** with her."

"Ohhh, it fair point... **Thank you, Rex-Rex! Thank you, Nia! Tora promise he will striiiive to be best Driver ever!**"

> (**Choice 2:**) "What's the most important thing, for a Driver?"

"_Hoh,_ Tora been thinking about that **a lot**. Love towards Blade is important."

"L-l-love?"

Rex was surprised, "Not an answer I was **expecting**..."

"Tora observe and Tora analyze... And Tora note, **all Drivers** have **love** for their Blades! Example, Rex-Rex **love** Pyra, and Nia **love** Dromarch!"

"**I LOVE PYRA?!!!**" Caught him on his feet. 

"**R-REX LOVES PYRA?!!!**" That's Nia's focus. 

"Love that Tora feel for Poppi is- also unsurpassed thing. But just because Tora **have love**, _not mean Tora can necessarily be Driver..._"

Rex: "Yeah, but still..."

"Hang on, Rex." Nia had a suggestion. "We're getting bogged down here. Can we just- **straight up ask Poppi** and be done with this?"

"**That's a great idea!** Let's get Poppi here."

After Poppi arrived, Rex asked, "Hey, Poppi. **What would you do**- if Tora said- he wanted to quit being a Driver?"

"Poppi probably break down in tears, is what!"

"Oh, **meh-meh**-meh-meh! Tora work to be **best** Driver he can!" And he went back playing with Poppi. Tora and Poppi behind them, Rex exclaimed, "**Well**, that was pretty easy!"

"Ugh! I've just got no patience for this sorta- **non**-problem."

---

### A Tora and Poppi Production

Inside Mymona Playhouse (Cole's theater) at Fonsa Myma, Tora and Poppi arranged a show for some members of the group. Tora started, "Ladies and gentlepon, thank you for join us here today! _We hope you_ enjoy performance of **'Uraya Goes To War'.**"

Rex exclaimed, "This is gonna be **so much** fun!"

Gramps wondered, "Are we the only ones watching? **Where did Nia go off to?**"

"**I dunno!**"

Tora continued narrating, "**Queen Raqura! Me** think time has come to go to war with Mor Ardain!"

"This is **most** sudden, War Minister." Nia had participated herself in the show. 

Dromarch was surprised, "My lady...?"

Rex cheered, "Wow, **you're great, Nia!**"

She can have out-of-performance narratives, sniped at Rex, "Shut it, you! I didn't ask to take part in this farce!"

Tora continued, "**Ahem**. This not sudden, Your Majesty. We preparing for war **ever since** Mor Ardain take occupation- of Gormott."

"Then the preparations- are- complete?" she returned to her role playing. 

"Preparations _go steady for long time_, **but**- we can quickly make complete. Mor Ardain soon try to **conquer other countries aside** from Gormott. We **cannot** allow ambitions to succeed. **Must start war** at earliest possibility!"

"I see... So be it then. Let us... make war."

"**Wait- one- moment, please!**" Poppi rejected. 

"You have concerns, High Minister?"

"Titan of Mor Ardain quickly becoming so barren, crops cannot be grown. **Meanwhile, we** have rich soil, producing **much delicious** Gromrice. Why **bother with war** when Mor Ardain **collapse on its own** from famine?"

"A valid question."

Tora rebutted quick, "No no! _If we wait, Mor Ardain just conquer_ **more territories** like Gormott. _With more territories, Mor Ardain become_ still greater threat! **Eeeeeeeeven** if Mor Ardain **Titan collapse completely**, _may still be difficult_ to defeat whole Empire!"

"There no need to be hasty." argued Poppi. "Mor Ardain still not have enough territory or supplies to properly provide for own people. Gormott alone not enough to support whoooole of Ardainian population. In other words, more prudent to wait for Mor Ardain to grow weaker before attacking."

Nia thought that "Your argument- is- compelling."

Tora resolved "**That not happen today or tomorrow** though! Noooo! Might take **many** decades to happen, _or even_ centuries! We can **not allow Mor Ardain threat** to remain **longer than necessary!**"

"That- quite- true-, but now is not time- to rush into things! War preparations may be in progress, but still not in optimal condition!"

Tora looked to Nia, "Oh urgh This argument **never end**. Your Majesty **must make FINAL DECISION!!!**"

She jumped on her feet, "Huh? You want me to decide?"

Poppi agreed, "Your Majesty is Queeeeen of Uraya.{{footnote: On a note, in Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Nia did became a Queen.}}"

"O-o-ohh yeah, right..."

> Choose: "Let's go to war!"  
> or "Let's wait a little longer."

> (**Choice 1:**) "Let's go to war!"

Tora was impressed! Poppi said nothing. 

> (**Choice 2:**) "Let's wait a little longer."

Tora was speechless! Poppi was impressed. 

(Regardless of which choices being chosen, they continued below.)

Nia was confused. Why are they looking at her? "What now? Did you both forget your lines?"

Tora explained, "Argh... Script of 'Uraya Goes To War' end here. **No more lines** to say."

Poppi addressed the audiences, "Thank you for coming today, everyone!"

Gramps noted, "I see, I see! By showing this play to the children, you'll get them to think for themselves about whether Uraya should go to war."

Dromarch: "Mmm, that's quite clever, actually."

Rex agreed, "It's a difficult question. I can see the kids having split opinions, too."

Nia, meanwhile, was getting fired up, "You force me to take part in this thing, and then it just ends like that? This is SO not satisfying!"

### Telling Roc about Vandham

On a hill overlooking Garfont village, Rex told Roc, after reawakening him, "There's a **really great** view of the whole village from here, right?"

"Indeed! It's... quite- the vista. Such a fine village it is, too. Certainly no one is **awash** with luxury down there. But still, the people are remarkably happy. Even when life is hard, they keep- smiling, **keep looking forward.**"

"I think of it as the continuation of Vandham's spirit. He may be gone, but his good deeeeeds outlive him."

"Yes, it's a fine thought, _knowing- the man who- built and protected this village was once my Driver._"

> Choose: "Do you want to hear about Vandham?"  
> or "Do you wish you could stay here?"

> (**Choice 1:**) "Do you want to hear about Vandham?"

"Well... _it seems a tad rude- to go on about my old Driver in front of my current one..._ But I've heard he was quite the remarkable man. Naturally, I'm curious."

"He was one of the good guys, all right. He had **big** muscles, a **big** voice, and an **even bigger** heart. It was Vandham who taught me the basics of being a Driver. More than that, in fact. He taught me all about Blades, how to fight, the way of the world... I didn't know him for long, but he taught me the most important things I know."

"Is that right? He was the kind of- solid, powerful, and dashing sort that is irresistible to the opposite sex, I'll wager."

"Ermmm, I'm not sure if he was that much of a hit with the ladies. But he was a great guy, that's for sure."

"Hmmm... I feel the loss of my memories- of him- very keenly."

"Well, don't worry, Roc. Like I said before, the people of this village are carrying on what he started. **And so are we.** I hope I can become as good as him some day. I may still have a way to go. But **just you stick with me**, Roc, and **one day, you'll see!**"

"I don't doubt it."

> (**Choice 2:**) "Do you wish you could stay here?"

"I wouldn't say that. After all, it's not like _I have any memories of my time in this village._ But **I believe something** lives on here. Something of Vandham, and- of myself. When I think about it, I can't help but- get **a tad** sentimental."

"Yeah, I know what you mean. It's like the village is full of memories. Memories of... you, memories of Vandham."

"I wonder how he and I used to spend our days..."

"I think... you probably both lived pretty normal lives, really."

"Normal?"

"That's right. Vandham was the everyday sort, you know? I mean, he'd get up in the morning, see to the kids, then he'd just eat a big sausage sandwich. Evening, he'd drink a beer and- chat about what he was up to. Then he'd just get a bit sleepy, and go to bed. I think that's what he was trying to build here. A place where people could just... live normal lives. I think that's what both of you were always fighting for."

"Fighting for _a normal life? Then perhaps even now, that_... normal life is what the people of this village hold most dear... Tell me, Rex... Would you say Vandham... _was a 'kind'- person?_"

"Kind, errrrr... I mean, he was straight up with everyone. Maybe even blunt sometimes. But he was a real gentle giant. He'd probably get mad at me for saying it, but I think he was a lot like a father. He's someone that I looked up to. Someone I'd like to **be like** someday."

"I can see you hold him in **great regard**, Rex. I only wish I could have **met him myself.**"

"He did everything he could to protect us. I bet he's still watching over us from somewhere, even now..."

"Well, **in that case**, I'd better make sure he **always sees me** at my best!"

"**Yeah, I reckon if we don't live up to his expectations, we'll be in a RIIIGHT rollicking someday!**"
