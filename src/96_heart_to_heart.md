# Heart to Heart

### The Real Gramps

At the place where they were first washed up, Pyra, Rex, Gramps, Nia, Tora, and Poppi overlooked the foggy distant scene. 

![Where Rex and Pyra's adventure began](images/070_gormott_washed_up_place.jpg)

"We're back here. This is where my whole adventure with Rex really began." exclaimed Pyra. 

Nia: "Oh, right. This must be the spot here you and Rex washed up."

Rex added: "Though we only made it here thanks to Gramps's efforts."

Gramps: "And those efforts are the reason I'm like this now..." Talk about being in larvae form. 

Nia at least felt gratitude, reasoned, "Well, if you stayed that big you couldn't exactly travel with us. I'd say you're just right!"

"If I was my old self, I'd be able to carry you anywhere! Well, anywhere within reason. The World Tree would be pushing it."

"**Amazing!**" exclaimed Tora. "So how long it take you to get to Argentum from here?"

"At the current separation, let's see... About 10 days travel."

"That long?!" Nia couldn't believe what she'd just heard. 

"'You'd do it faster than that or you'd taste the whip!' is what I'm hearing."

"Of courseeee that's not what I mean. _But that_'s like 3 or 4 days by boat."

"My apologies. I'm not as young as I used to be."

Poppi don't understand, "What is point of worrying now Gramps not big any more?"

"True enough. That old body... is a thing of the past!"

Pyra walked up closer, commented, "Well I think you are _adorable like this._ I like it."

"Well, _that's very kind of you, Pyra._"

"Are you blushing, oldster?" Nia tried to look closer. 

He immediately blurt out, changed the topic as rapidly as he could, "**Tell me, Rex. Do you ever wish I was in my old form?**"

> Choose: "I liked it better when you were big."  
> or "I think you're better like this."

> (**Choice 1:**) "I liked it better when you were big."

"Oh, is that so? I suppose you found me very useful as a Titan."

"Huh?"

"I provided a home... carried you from place to place... Not to mention the salvaging crane{{footnote: That anchor.}} stuck you-know-where."

Scratching his head, "That's not really what I meant! It's just that you were so **big and dependable**. Like a dad, or, well, a real grandpa. **Besides**, I knew you in that form for most of my life. Everyone else only really knows you like this, but I'm not used to it."

Pyra: "Rex has a point. The time when I knew you before, Azurda, is very faint in my mind. This is the _Gramps_ I'm used to."

"Tora cannot imagine big Gramps!"

"Poppi never seen big Gramps, so **also cannot** picture."

Rex: "Right? That's what I thought. It's all about what you're used to."

Gramps, thinking, "Hmm... I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Though I know you're really just **pining** for the days when you could travel in comfort on my back."

> (**Choice 2:**) "I think you're better like this."

"**Oho! You prefer me this way?**" The excitement in his voice don't subside. 

"It's cool to have you riding on MY back for a change! **Just hearing** you **encourage me** from behind reeeeeaaaaally sets my heart at ease. And when you were big, we couldn't just, y'know, hang out or- walk together. I like being able to _stay close._"

"I see, I see..."

Pyra noticed, "You look rather pleased, Azurda."

"If I were to be honest, Rex's helmet is a little cramped. Not to mention the jolting and bumping and bouncing around. It's enough to make me lose my lunch at times. But... hearing Rex- say that, for the first time it made me- think that perhaps this- was- actually a good thing."

"I'm sorry about the jolting. Looks like I've gotta get used to this situation too."

"That's all right, Rex. I'll keep the words of encouragement coming! I shall endeavor to become... ever more reliable."

"Ummm... Actually, if you're planning on nagging me constantly, maybe I'll **pass**..."

Nia agreed, "_Yeah_, I wouldn't want to have Dromarch's nagging voice in my ear all the time, either..."

Gramps: "**Cheeky sods!**"

### Ardainian Technology

On the 1st Floor (American 2nd Floor) of Mòrag's ship, Rex, Tora, Poppi, Nia, Gramps, they were looking at the technology at the control room.{{footnote: Pyra and Dromarch wasn't there, probably because they don't have speeches, so the creator don't see a need to put them in. Though one personally would disagree; as in putting them in even if they don't have something to say would fare better in one's opinion. Plus, Gramps is inside but not speaking, sitting in Rex's helmet as decorative.}}

![Inside Mòrag's ship control room](images/071_morag_ship.jpg)

Nia noted, "The inside of a Titan battleship is way different from the Monoceros, huh..."

Poppi raised her hand and questioned, "What is Monoceros?"

"Rex, you saw it, right? Moored at a pier back in Goldmouth? Jin and co.'s black boat."{{footnote: That's the Argentum trade guild, when he first visited and noticed it in Chapter 1.}}

"**Aaaahhh**, that really impressive one! It runs without being hooked up to a Titan, right?"

"I'm no expert, but... yeah, looked like it."

Tora: "Sound **awesome! Tora want to see too!**"

Rex: "You won't get the chance, unless we see those Torna guys again."

"Meh, mehmeh, meh! Tora change mind. No need to see." The fear of getting attacked exceeded his curiosity. 

"Masterpon change mind at drop of hat..."

Rex turned their attention back to the panels before them, "Well, the Monoceros was pretty sweet, but this is nothing to scoff at either!"

Nia: "For sure. It's full of things I've never seen before."

Tora: "Ah! That's because this vessel is result of **latest** breakthroughs in **Ardainian tech!** Regular folk never so much as set foot on board!"

"You say, breakthroughs in technology, but what you mean... is salvaged stuff, right?"

Rex answered, "Ummm, not exclusively. I see lots of homegrown improvements as well. **Like this,** see? Whatever they've stuffed in here, it's been messed with so much, I can't tell what it was to start with."

Tora seemed to know, "That control panel. It transmit signal to Titan nerves. By running cables to different parts of Titan from here, can control signal flow much more better."

"**Whaaaattt??? That's amazing!**"

"And this cable itself have 2.4 time the speed and 12 time the capacity of previous iteration. In other words, it on whole other level to stuff other countries use!"

"Huuuuhh! So if they put this in a smaller Titan vessel, it would work **even better!**" The sense of excitement in his voice; but who was he thinking about? 

"**Pin-pon! Correct!**"

Nia, speaking to Poppi, "Grrrrh! They seem to be having fun, but it's all gibberish to me. Poppi, what do you think?"

> Choose: "That not even so bad..."  
> or "Why Masterpon act so proud?"

> (**Choice 1:**) "That not even so bad..."

"Oh really?"

"Poppi have access to **much varied** information. Considering interests of Masterpon, technology info is especially rich. So for Poppi is not issue, following conversation in question. Moreover, if necessary, Poppi could out-geek Masterpon if Poppi try." Her hands and feet jumped and juggled about a lot as she excitedly answered. 

"R-right, OK..." So she was the only one... "I'm sorry I doubted you."

"No worry, Nia. Poppi can also hold conversation on favorite bug dishes of Nia."

"You're too kind... I- should point out though, it's not **bugs** I like, but **fish.**"

"Meh? Poppi apologize. Poppi update her database now. Masterpon not always fastidious in data entry, so mistakes happen."

Heh heh heh, found the culprit, she shouted out, "**Tora! I like bugs now, do I?**" The look in her eyes. 

His fur stood on ends, "Meh-meh! Tora suddenly feel very unsafe. Rex-Rex, we should move on. If we stay here, something **bad** bound to happen!"

"Like what?" asked Rex, not yet sensing the situation. 

"**No time to waste, we go!**"

> (**Choice 2:**) "Why Masterpon act so proud?"

"**Ho-hoo! Tora very glad you ask!** That because- tech used in this Titan battleship is same as what Poppi's muscles and drivetrain use!"

"**Poppi is surprised!**"

"**But however** though! Ones that Poppi use are even more improved than these here!"

"**Yet more surprise!**"

Nia hypothesized, "Are you saying you stole the tech from Mor Ardain?"

Rex: "C'mon, Tora... Is that what you call sporting behavior?"

"**Tora take calculated risk in service to cause of scientific advancement...**" He reasoned to himself. "As result, not even Ardainian scientists capable of reverse-engineer Poppi systems! **So, no worries there!**"

Poppi's head dropped to ground, "Upon learning secret of Poppi's birth, Poppi feel sense of unease..."

"Ugh **E-everything fine!...** _Probably!_ **Now Rex-Rex! No time for chit-chat. Let's get going!**"

### Poppi's Unending Curiosity

At Melnath's Shoulder, overlooking the Cloud Sea on the plains outside Torigoth, Poppi asked, "Masterpon, Poppi have question."

![Melnath's Shoulder](images/072_melnath_shoulder.jpg)

"Pursuit of learning is **good thing**. Ask **anything** and Tora will answer!"

"Cloud Sea clearly visible from here. Height of Cloud Sea is different at different times. Why height change?"

"Meh-meh?! W-well, um..." Sweat started poring down Tora's face as he struggled with getting an explanation for her. Ah, scapegoat! With a cool tone, he said, "Tora let Rex-Rex answer that one!"

Poppi went to Rex and asked, "Rex, why cloud height change?"

"Well, let's see now... Maybe it's easier if you compare it to the clouds, in the sky. They come in all different shapes, right?"

"Some clouds very flat... Other clouds big and- fluffy!" noted Poppi.

"**Yeah, that's what I mean.** And the shape doesn't stay the same forever. The Cloud Sea is the same way. It's not always a flat surface, sometimes it gets... fluffed up. The height- and shape of it isn't constant. It's alwaaays changing. Not- **suddenly**, like the weather, but- gradually."

Gramps: "It more likely than not... to change overnight."

"**Yeah! That sounds about right!**"

"Very interesting."{{footnote: Even more interesting: how do you notice the height of the sea change when you're living in a boat? On land, you can see that the water cover more beaches at certain times, while cover less beaches at recede sea level; but if you're living on a Titan which water always reached the same level (unless you put up more weight or less weight so it had different levels), a floating object is probably constant to changing sea level, theoretically. One don't know practically, though.}}

"Oh, but it's only the Titans like this one, and the Mor Ardain Titan that affect the Cloud Sea's height. Ones like the Trade Guild Titan **Goldmouth** just float on the surface, so they don't affect it."{{footnote: So does this means Gormott and Mor Ardain titan don't float on the surface, but have their feet on the seabed, 'walking in water'?}}

"Makes lots of sense!"

"I guess that's about the extent of what I know."

"Very much thanks, Rex. Poppi learn a lot! Rex must know **lots** of things. **Poppi have even more questions to ask!**"

He jumped a step back, "Oh, really? I don't know if I can answer everything..."

Tora: "Poppi..."

> Choose: "Should not bother Rex-Rex too much!"  
> or "Try ask Dromarch instead!"

> (**Choice 1:**) "Should not bother Rex-Rex too much!"

"Hmm... OK then. Poppi leave questions there for now."

"Thanks, Tora." You saved my skin! "I know quite a lot about the Cloud Sea because of my salvaging **work**, but I'm not so hot on general knowledge. I probably wouldn't have been able to answer anything else..."

Pyra reassured him, "Don't worry, Rex. If you don't know the answer, there's always a chance that I will!"

"Thanks, Pyra!"

"And if even I don't know, we can still fall back on Azurda."

Gramps: "True enough. I've been around for quite a while{{footnote: Ahem, few hundred years of waking moments.}}, so I could most likely answer any questions Poppi might have. And there's Dromarch as well. _Between us, I'm sure we could find an answer to most questions._"

Rex: "You're not wrong there. If all of us work together, we can figure out pretty much anything!"

Pyra: "I guess it's not just battle where teamwork is important!"

"Yeah!"

> (**Choice 2:**) "Try ask **Dromarch** instead!"

Rex: "That's a good idea. I reckon Dromarch is more knowledgeable than I am."

"Ohhhh, you flatter me. I'm- no expert compared to our resident Titan."

Gramps: "Wha- Don't drag me into this!"

"I have no memories of the time, before I bonded with my lady, after all."

"That's no reason to throw me into the cooking pot! What am I supposed to say, if Poppi asks 'Where do babies come from?' or something like that?!"

"Mmmm... Tell her they are delivered by a flying Tirkin.{{footnote: a big-beak bird that wields Iron-age weaponry like spears and wear an armor.}}"

"That kind of quick thinking is why you're a better man for the job."

"Ah, you over-**estimate** me. **Still, if the mighty** TItan is not willing, I suppose, we will have to rely on, my lady, instead."

"Hooooooold it, Dromarch. I want nooooo part in this mess!"

Poppi, in the meantime, eavesdropping their conversation and passing the bucks, exclaimed, "Masterpon, Poppi think Poppi **already** learn something."

"Huh, learn what?"

"This what people mean when they talk about 'passing the buck'!"

### Blushy-Crushy

At the canteen (Plaza of Reprieve) at Garfont Village, where Vandham lived, Pyra exclaimed, "I made tea for everyone. Help yourself."

![At the canteen](images/088_pyra_tea.jpg)

Tora: "Oh, noooo. Pyra getting it **completely** wrong."

"Oh? Would you... rather have something else, Tora?"

"Oh no no, that not it ummm. Tora just think that if- _Pyra going to_- **do** maid job, Pyra should be more... _maidy._"

"_Maidy?_"

Nia complaint, "Tora. Pyra was kind enough to make tea. Can't you just be bloody grateful?"

"**Oh, Tora knowwwww that,** but, also... Strive for perfection is important goal! Tora feel- very- strongly about this! _Most important thing for maid is... um... Nopon word is, uh... 'blushy-crushy'._ **Pyra still quite- lacking in that area!**"

"I... I-I'm lacking? _But what_ on Alrest is 'blushy-crushy'?"

"It uh... what every man, looking for. If Pyra **master art** of blushy-crushy, then all men fall at Pyra's feet!"

"A-a-all men? Really?"

"Yes! Uh It is... known fact!"

Nia: "Listen, Pyra. There's no point paying attention to this little twerp." He must be wanting to fall to her feet himself. 

"But..."

They haven't yet argued, Tora already cut in, "Is Pyra interested in essence of maidiness?"

> Choose: "Yes I am!"  
> or "If you think Rex would like that..."

> (**Choice 1:**) "Yes, I am!"

Nia was terrified, "You cannot be serious!"

Tora was overjoyed, "**Good attitude!** Tora will teach maid art of **blushy-crushy!** Welcome Tora's maidiest assistant!"

"_How may I be of service, Masterpon? Tee-hee!_" Just the opening is already so maidy. 

Pyra was surprised, "P-Poppi?"

Nia: "What the hell happened to you? Is this some kinda malfunction?" Recall, when she wasn't there, what misprogramming Tora had gave her when she first start up. 

"_Poppi's Maidiest Mode has been activated. Tee-hee!_"

Tora: "**Hoho! Maidiest Poppi** will teach you all about essence of maid behavior."

Standing next to each other, Pyra watched Poppi, she started, "Blushy-crushy, is external magnification of love feelings inside heart. Poppi will teach magic way to magnify **love** feelings. **Chant with Poppi.**"

"O-OK!"

"**Cutey-cutey, lovely-lovely, blushy-crushy, tee-hee!**"

Nia was already not feeling right, warned, "Pyra, please do NOT tell me you're gonna..."

She wasn't listening, trying to replicate, "C-cutey-cutey? Lovely... lovely... Blushy... Crushy... Tee-hee!" Except hers was more bland than Poppi's. 

"**Whop**, there we go." Nia felt wanting to throw up at any moments. 

"**Nnnnn-Not quite! Copy Poppi... _exactly!_**" The judge determined. 

"Yes, coach!"

"Please, Pyra... Come back to us... While you still can!"

> (**Choice 2:**) "If you think Rex _would like_ that..."

"Rex-Rex is **boy**, so he definitely not immune to the... _charms of blushy-crushy._ It definitely worth Pyra's time to learn **essence** of maidiness."

"I see... **OK**, I'm ready! Tora, tell me what to do!" such straightforwardness. 

"Uh, Pyra?" Nia was sweating cold sweat. 

"Tora will now introduce assistant to help teach **essence of maidiness!**"

"**How may I be of service, Mr. Rex, sir? Tee-hee!**"

Pyra was surprised, "P-Poppi?"

Nia: "What is this, Tora, some kinda... malfunction?"

Poppi answered for her, "**Do not worry. This just 'Rex-Focused Blushy-Crushy Maximization Mode'. Have a good day _salvaging_, Mr. Rex, sir! Tee-hee-hee!**"

"**Mr.Rex... sir?**" Nia jumped on her feet. 

Pyra felt blushingly red, "S-s-so... this is... 'blushy-crushy'..."

"OK, Pyra, copy what Poppi say."

Side by side, Poppi started, "**Mr. Rex, sir, Poppi is** blushy-crushy **just for you.**"

Immediately she tried, quite blandly, her feeling of shame shot to max, "Mr. Rex... sir... Pyra- is... blushy-crushy... just for you?"

"**No no, no, no! Rex-Rex will never fall** at Pyra's feet with such **low level of blushy-crushy!** Try again, from top!"

Like the boss female manager whom shouted commands, she called out, "**Mr. Rex! Sir! Pyra** is blushy-crushy! **Just for you!**"

"_Not there yet!_"

Nia: "I... I give up. I can't watch this any more."

---

### Tora's Angst

At the stomach of Uraya, above Farlaine Central Pools, Tora exclaimed, "**Outstanding!** It thanks to Tora becoming Driver that Tora come to this place! Blades and Drivers **MOST BEST EVER!!!** Oh, that remind Tora! **Rex-Rex, Nia!** Tora need- _little_ consultation."

![Uraya Stomach](images/151_uraya_stomach.jpg)

Nia: "Uh, a consultation? With us?"

"Tora have **big** problem right now. Recently... Tora finally realized. Tora is..."

"Tora- is...?" urged Rex.

"Tora is not- _very useful in battle!_"

"Ugh!" "Oh!"

"Why friends silent?"

"Oh, uhhh... We're just a bit surprised." answered Rex.

Nia added, "I mean, I just never really took you for the self-assessing type."

"Org, _too cruel._"

"Naaaahhh, I mean, you fight **just fine**, Tora."

"Poppi deserve all the credit. She pass weapon... and do all the things so Tora can fight like **real Driver.** Tora sometimes think, if he remove program of Poppi, Poppi fighting- **alone**- _would be most efficient..._"

Nia was surprised, "**Seriously? Wow, you go girl!**"

"**That why Tora just feel like- small furry ball and chain!**"

Rex: "Well, errrr... I wouldn't go **that** far..."

"Anyway, Tora wonder if there any point to Tora **still** being Driver. Maybe it better for everyone if- **Tora retire** and assume supervisor duty on sideline?"

"Ohhhh, Tora! Nia, what do you think?"

> Choose: "Why did you want to be a Driver?"  
> or "What's the most important thing, for a Driver?"

> (**Choice 1:**) "Why did you want to be a Driver?"

He turned around and looked at the scene, reflecting his life, answered, "It not clear to Tora anymore... Starting with Grampypon, dearest wish of family was to **successfully create artificial Blade**. So, it natural that Tora start to wish it too!"

"Well, do you know **why** your grandad wanted to make an artificial Blade?"

"Surely it because..." He turned around and surprised the group with the most controversy reasoning, "**He want to be famous!**"

Rex: "That sounds like a lame reason..."

"**But** Nopon Driver is **rare** thing! Nopon who become Driver almost **sure** to become celebrity!"

"Was that your motivation as well, then?"

"Mmmmmeeeeehhhh... **Not** exactly. Tora want to be **like Rex-Rex!**"

"Like me?"

"At first, Tora simply yeaaaarn to be Driver, not- think- too much about it. But... _after me travel with Rex-Rex and friends_, he start to think different! Saving persons in need, facing all challenges... **Rex-Rex** is Tora's **idea** of **perfect Driver!**"

"It... feels kinda strange when you say that to my face..."

Nia wondered, "Rex, _a perfect Driver? I'm not convinced_. But it looks like you've got a clear goal in mind, Tora."

"**Hey, hold on!**"

Nia ignored him, continued, "Honestly, that's all you need! Tora, you should keep being a Driver. As- long- as you have goals to achieve, there's **no** reason for you to stop. And your Blade will help you in that. **Poppi shouldn't have to fight alone. You need** to be **right there** with her."

"Ohhh, it fair point... **Thank you, Rex-Rex! Thank you, Nia! Tora promise he will striiiive to be best Driver ever!**"

> (**Choice 2:**) "What's the most important thing, for a Driver?"

"_Hoh,_ Tora been thinking about that **a lot**. Love towards Blade is important."

"L-l-love?"

Rex was surprised, "Not an answer I was **expecting**..."

"Tora observe and Tora analyze... And Tora note, **all Drivers** have **love** for their Blades! Example, Rex-Rex **love** Pyra, and Nia **love** Dromarch!"

"**I LOVE PYRA?!!!**" Caught him on his feet. 

"**R-REX LOVES PYRA?!!!**" That's Nia's focus. 

"Love that Tora feel for Poppi is- also unsurpassed thing. But just because Tora **have love**, _not mean Tora can necessarily be Driver..._"

Rex: "Yeah, but still..."

"Hang on, Rex." Nia had a suggestion. "We're getting bogged down here. Can we just- **straight up ask Poppi** and be done with this?"

"**That's a great idea!** Let's get Poppi here."

After Poppi arrived, Rex asked, "Hey, Poppi. **What would you do**- if Tora said- he wanted to quit being a Driver?"

"Poppi probably break down in tears, is what!"

"Oh, **meh-meh**-meh-meh! Tora work to be **best** Driver he can!" And he went back playing with Poppi. Tora and Poppi behind them, Rex exclaimed, "**Well**, that was pretty easy!"

"Ugh! I've just got no patience for this sorta- **non**-problem."

---

### A Tora and Poppi Production

Inside Mymona Playhouse (Cole's theater) at Fonsa Myma, Tora and Poppi arranged a show for some members of the group. Tora started, "Ladies and gentlepon, thank you for join us here today! _We hope you_ enjoy performance of **'Uraya Goes To War'.**"

Rex exclaimed, "This is gonna be **so much** fun!"

Gramps wondered, "Are we the only ones watching? **Where did Nia go off to?**"

"**I dunno!**"

Tora continued narrating, "**Queen Raqura! Me** think time has come to go to war with Mor Ardain!"

"This is **most** sudden, War Minister." Nia had participated herself in the show. 

Dromarch was surprised, "My lady...?"

Rex cheered, "Wow, **you're great, Nia!**"

She can have out-of-performance narratives, sniped at Rex, "Shut it, you! I didn't ask to take part in this farce!"

Tora continued, "**Ahem**. This not sudden, Your Majesty. We preparing for war **ever since** Mor Ardain take occupation- of Gormott."

"Then the preparations- are- complete?" she returned to her role playing. 

"Preparations _go steady for long time_, **but**- we can quickly make complete. Mor Ardain soon try to **conquer other countries aside** from Gormott. We **cannot** allow ambitions to succeed. **Must start war** at earliest possibility!"

"I see... So be it then. Let us... make war."

"**Wait- one- moment, please!**" Poppi rejected. 

"You have concerns, High Minister?"

"Titan of Mor Ardain quickly becoming so barren, crops cannot be grown. **Meanwhile, we** have rich soil, producing **much delicious** Gromrice. Why **bother with war** when Mor Ardain **collapse on its own** from famine?"

"A valid question."

Tora rebutted quick, "No no! _If we wait, Mor Ardain just conquer_ **more territories** like Gormott. _With more territories, Mor Ardain become_ still greater threat! **Eeeeeeeeven** if Mor Ardain **Titan collapse completely**, _may still be difficult_ to defeat whole Empire!"

"There no need to be hasty." argued Poppi. "Mor Ardain still not have enough territory or supplies to properly provide for own people. Gormott alone not enough to support whoooole of Ardainian population. In other words, more prudent to wait for Mor Ardain to grow weaker before attacking."

Nia thought that "Your argument- is- compelling."

Tora resolved "**That not happen today or tomorrow** though! Noooo! Might take **many** decades to happen, _or even_ centuries! We can **not allow Mor Ardain threat** to remain **longer than necessary!**"

"That- quite- true-, but now is not time- to rush into things! War preparations may be in progress, but still not in optimal condition!"

Tora looked to Nia, "Oh urgh This argument **never end**. Your Majesty **must make FINAL DECISION!!!**"

She jumped on her feet, "Huh? You want me to decide?"

Poppi agreed, "Your Majesty is Queeeeen of Uraya.{{footnote: On a note, in Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Nia did became a Queen.}}"

"O-o-ohh yeah, right..."

> Choose: "Let's go to war!"  
> or "Let's wait a little longer."

> (**Choice 1:**) "Let's go to war!"

Tora was impressed! Poppi said nothing. 

> (**Choice 2:**) "Let's wait a little longer."

Tora was speechless! Poppi was impressed. 

(Regardless of which choices being chosen, they continued below.)

Nia was confused. Why are they looking at her? "What now? Did you both forget your lines?"

Tora explained, "Argh... Script of 'Uraya Goes To War' end here. **No more lines** to say."

Poppi addressed the audiences, "Thank you for coming today, everyone!"

Gramps noted, "I see, I see! By showing this play to the children, you'll get them to think for themselves about whether Uraya should go to war."

Dromarch: "Mmm, that's quite clever, actually."

Rex agreed, "It's a difficult question. I can see the kids having split opinions, too."

Nia, meanwhile, was getting fired up, "You force me to take part in this thing, and then it just ends like that? This is SO not satisfying!"

### Telling Roc about Vandham

On a hill overlooking Garfont village, Rex told Roc, after reawakening him, "There's a **really great** view of the whole village from here, right?"

"Indeed! It's... quite- the vista. Such a fine village it is, too. Certainly no one is **awash** with luxury down there. But still, the people are remarkably happy. Even when life is hard, they keep- smiling, **keep looking forward.**"

"I think of it as the continuation of Vandham's spirit. He may be gone, but his good deeeeeds outlive him."

"Yes, it's a fine thought, _knowing- the man who- built and protected this village was once my Driver._"

> Choose: "Do you want to hear about Vandham?"  
> or "Do you wish you could stay here?"

> (**Choice 1:**) "Do you want to hear about Vandham?"

"Well... _it seems a tad rude- to go on about my old Driver in front of my current one..._ But I've heard he was quite the remarkable man. Naturally, I'm curious."

"He was one of the good guys, all right. He had **big** muscles, a **big** voice, and an **even bigger** heart. It was Vandham who taught me the basics of being a Driver. More than that, in fact. He taught me all about Blades, how to fight, the way of the world... I didn't know him for long, but he taught me the most important things I know."

"Is that right? He was the kind of- solid, powerful, and dashing sort that is irresistible to the opposite sex, I'll wager."

"Ermmm, I'm not sure if he was that much of a hit with the ladies. But he was a great guy, that's for sure."

"Hmmm... I feel the loss of my memories- of him- very keenly."

"Well, don't worry, Roc. Like I said before, the people of this village are carrying on what he started. **And so are we.** I hope I can become as good as him some day. I may still have a way to go. But **just you stick with me**, Roc, and **one day, you'll see!**"

"I don't doubt it."

> (**Choice 2:**) "Do you wish you could stay here?"

"I wouldn't say that. After all, it's not like _I have any memories of my time in this village._ But **I believe something** lives on here. Something of Vandham, and- of myself. When I think about it, I can't help but- get **a tad** sentimental."

"Yeah, I know what you mean. It's like the village is full of memories. Memories of... you, memories of Vandham."

"I wonder how he and I used to spend our days..."

"I think... you probably both lived pretty normal lives, really."

"Normal?"

"That's right. Vandham was the everyday sort, you know? I mean, he'd get up in the morning, see to the kids, then he'd just eat a big sausage sandwich. Evening, he'd drink a beer and- chat about what he was up to. Then he'd just get a bit sleepy, and go to bed. I think that's what he was trying to build here. A place where people could just... live normal lives. I think that's what both of you were always fighting for."

"Fighting for _a normal life? Then perhaps even now, that_... normal life is what the people of this village hold most dear... Tell me, Rex... Would you say Vandham... _was a 'kind'- person?_"

"Kind, errrrr... I mean, he was straight up with everyone. Maybe even blunt sometimes. But he was a real gentle giant. He'd probably get mad at me for saying it, but I think he was a lot like a father. He's someone that I looked up to. Someone I'd like to **be like** someday."

"I can see you hold him in **great regard**, Rex. I only wish I could have **met him myself.**"

"He did everything he could to protect us. I bet he's still watching over us from somewhere, even now..."

"Well, **in that case**, I'd better make sure he **always sees me** at my best!"

"**Yeah, I reckon if we don't live up to his expectations, we'll be in a RIIIGHT rollicking someday!**"

### How to be a Veteran Driver

One night, near the port where they disembarked in Mor Ardain, in the Cargo Transportation Zone, suddenly, Tora had a really weird statement, "Rex-Rex! Tora have to ask for friend as fellow man's man! Tora want to gain understanding of life as adventurer!"

"As an adventurer?" What do you mean? 

"Rex-Rex is role-model of Tora! That why Tora want to learn **everything** he can about being Rex-Rex!"

"This is all very sudden, Tora. What's going on?"

Gramps had a different feeling about this, "Come now, Rex. Don't feel too important, he just wants to talk."

Poppi: "In any case, it not so common for Masterpon to ask something so directly."

"Exactly! Tora being **earnest** like **never before!** Hm! Tora submit as evidence: this direct, unflinching eye contact!" And he stared at Rex with his big eyes.

Rex looked closely and noticed, "_Wow_, your pupils are really dilated..."

Gramps commented, "That's what you get, staying up all night..."

Poppi made up her mind, "All right, tonight Masterpon go to bed early." That includes some... drastic measures if he don't. 

"**Meh-meh-meh-meh! Enough!** Tora's eyes are worry of Tora! It no matter! This important! Tora want to be like Rex-Rex! Rex-Rex! Pleaaaaase, teach Tora!"

> Choose: "I'll teach you all that life's taught me!"  
> or: "Maybe it's better if Nia teaches you?"

> (**Choice 1:**) "I'll teach you all that life's taught me!"

"Thank you! Tora cannot wait!"

"All right, Tora, listen up. To become a responsible adult, here's what you need to do. Firstly, you've got to take good care of your tools!"

"**Ah, Tora very good at that!** Runs Poppi's diagnostics every day!" He held out his wings to stop Rex from speaking more. 

"Indeed. Masterpon keep Poppi in impeccable state of maintenance."

"Secondly, you've got to take good care... of your friends! If you don't have friends to rely on, you'll be in trouble when a big job comes around!"

"_Hum hum hum hum hum, Tora see._ Tora always work alone until now, so- that point- _still a little new_ to Tora."

"And **most importantly, number three!**"

"Yes, yes?"

"Correctly triangulating wreckage coordinates!"

"**Ah, of course!** Tora can see that very important!" He answered without thinking; then it struck his conscious, "_One moment. Wreckage coordinates?_"

"That's right. If you mess up the coordinates, all the prep you've done goes down the drain. You might lose out on any loot you could've got otherwise..."

"_Ohhh..._" Tora is not salvager, meh! 

Gramps quietly reminded, "_Um, Rex. Isn't that salvaging you're talking about?_"

"**Huh? Yeah, why?**"

Tora raised up his wings, "**One moment, please!** _Why Rex-Rex talking about salvaging?_"

"You wanted to know about adventure, yeah? And what greater adventure is there than salvaging?"

His wings fluttered, "Tora want to know Driver wisdom! Have no use for salvager wisdom! Meh!"

"**WHUH?!!**"

"Masterpon, it seem that ask Rex about art of being Driver not bear fruit."

Gramps added, "After all, Rex is a rookie too..."

"_Tora is disappoint..._"

"**I really thought you were thinking of being a salvager, Tora...**"

He turned his back on Rex immediately, not giving face, "Meh, it fine. Tora ask Nia." Immediately, he walked away. 

"**H-Hang on, Tora! Let me... Let me try again!**" And he went after him. 

> (**Choice 2:**) "Maybe it's better if Nia teaches you? OK, so you ant to know about being a Driver, right?"{{footnote: Because he continued speaking after the choice's textbox, we just continued it here than open a new line.}}

"Right!"

"Does it bother Masterpon when someone say he no good at weapon pass?" Poppi wondered. 

"Of course it bother Tora! I mean, _weapon pass is crucial element_ of Driver-Blade coordination. If someone say me not so great at that, Tora's self-esteem plunge is par for course!"

"I know where you're coming from, but... Uh, maybe that's all the more reason to ask Nia? **She's the experienced** one around here..."

Tora felt disappointed, "Mehhhhh... Tora get it. Will ask and come back."

After he returned, he passed on wisdom of Nia, "Nia just say, with time, body of Driver learn to do it by muscle memory..."

Poppi felt disappointed this time, "Answer seem somewhat... dismissive?"

"Ah, that's a shame... **Hey, but, maybe- I can still help? I think Pyra and I manage OK, so...**"

"Actually, Nia refer to Rex-Rex as well."

Poppi had memorized her exact phrase, proudly repeated, "Poppi believe 'the kid's green as freshly mowed grass himself'... _were her exact words._"

"**Seriously?!!! That's what she thinks of me?**"

"Oh chin up, Rex-Rex."

Poppi: "Indeed! Have much time to live and learn!"

"**Yeahhhh!!! We'll get there!**"

Gramps commented, "He says he'll help, but then he's the one who needs pepping up..."

### Dromarch's Wisdom

At the capital city of Mor Ardain, Alba Cavanich, Nharil Central Plaza, Dromarch called for her attention, "My Lady... Over there. The capital's standing army."

"I see 'em." There were children behind them playing, and some other adults over at the lamppost chatting. 

Rex and Pyra just went up to them, Rex suggested, "Let's keep our distance, yeah? Best let sleeping Gogols lie."

"Good call."

Dromarch had other wisdom, shared, "Be not alarmed. The troops that captured us- were Ardainian military, yes, but from the Gor-motti regiment."

"Those aren't the same?" Pyra wondered. 

"Mmm. Quite different, in fact. **One can learn many things**- while in a Titan battleship's brig, and I made- good use- of the opportunity."

Nia sighed, "_Damn. They chucked me into solitary_, so I don't know anything..."

Dromarch continued, "It does seem they have separate procedures for Blades and Drivers. In any case, once- I abandoned thoughts of staging a break-out, I did make sure to keep my ears open for intelligence."

Pyra asked, "Did you hear anything else?"

"Mmm... Let me think... The soldiers over there are, as I said previously, from the capital's garrison..." He's referring the soldiers that's guarding the buildings, probably military. "But those other ones actually belong to the First Imperial Guard, 2nd Battalion." That's the one guarding the bridge connecting Alba Cavanich to the Castle. 

![First Imperial Guard, 2nd Battalion soldiers guarding the bridge](images/167_imperial_guards.jpg)

"Huh? What's the difference?" Rex don't understand. 

"Beyond the bridge is Hardhaigh Palace, the imperial residence. Therefore..."

It clicked in Pyra's mind, "**Oh, I've got it!** The palace guards belong to a different unit. **Of course!**"

"**Indeed!** Then, above the Imperial Guard rank and file, you have the **Carraig special** guard unit. And higher yet, the Special Inquisitor, The Flamebringer herself."

"Wow!" Rex was impressed. 

Nia was bored and confused, "_Armies, man._ I could never deal with all this **hierarchy** crap."

"Ever heard the expression, 'know- thy- enemy'...?" asked Dromarch.

> Choose: "Nia, how was Torna organized?"  
> or: "Got any other good ones, Dromarch?"

> (**Choice 1:**) Rex wondered, "Nia, how was Torna organized?"

"Torna? It was all... centered around Jin. Not exactly structured, though. But we all had our assignments."

![Alba Cavanich with all the desert sand blowing in the background and the industrialized structures](images/168_alba_cavanich.jpg)

"What was yours, Nia?" wondered Pyra.

"I was..."

Rex interrupted her, "Naptime specialist?"

"**Shut it!** I was, uh, general- support. I hadn't been there long, so- I- mostly just helped out with whatever."

"**Hah. Not much of a change, then.**"

Dromarch agreed, "It is, as you say."

Nia lashed out at him, "Stop making it sound like I'm some useless layabout!" Then she felt the need to explain herself, "I mean, I can make _ruska dumplings and stuff_, so..."

Cooking! Pyra immediately invited, "Well then, maybe we could cook something together?"

"Mm-hmm! OK, you're on!"

Dromarch had worries, "**My Lady, are you sure that's err...**"

She decided to use action to prove it, "Both of you'll sing a different song when I stuff your faces with my food!"

Cold sweat ran down Dromarch's manes, "(sigh)... You have best **steel** yourself, Master Rex. My lady's cooking... is not what anyone would call... 'conventionally tasty'..."

Rex backed up a sec, "Ugh... Maybe I shouldn't have riled her up..."

> (**Choice 2:**) Rex wondered: "Got any other good ones, Dromarch?"

"The smallest unit in the Ardainian army's structure... is the **ten-soldier** decade. It includes **eight** foot soldiers, alongside the squad leader and a deputy. Six to ten of these decades can then form a unit called- a century. But eight- is the usual number."

"Haaaaaahhhh, neat..."

"Mm hmm..." He rubbed his face as he showered in pride. "Master Rex, you did ask for a 'good one', correct?"

"I did."

"Would you not say that was a 'good one', then?" He wanted a specific praise, LOL...

But Rex was so confused, "Uhhhhh, which part?"

Dromarch reminded him, "(sigh)... I said that commonly, **eight** decades form a century. **Eighty men**... and yet, they are... **a century.**"

"**Ohhhh, now I get it!**"

Nia quietly suggested, "_Rex, he's done his best, so just throw him a bone, will ya?_"

"**Ahh yeah, no, that was a VERY good one! Uh-huh, VERY good.**"

"**I have- doubts- about your sincerity...**"

---

### Unforgiving Terrain

In the upper level of Mor Ardain, Jelidorend Highlands, Tora complaint, "Mor Ardain so full of **wasteland** and hard rocks... Not easy for walking!"

Rex suggested, "Shall we take a rest around here?"

"**Good idea**, yes!" Immediately he agreed. 

Gramps suggested, "You need to toughen up a bit, Tora."

Tora rebutted, "Tora live whole life cooped up in house working on building Poppi! _Not used to walking long distance! If only Tora could_ flitter-flutter like Gramps..."

"Well, you have those big ear... wing... things."

He fluttered, "Nopon wings not for flying! Could flap forever and not reach sky!"

Rex had another suggestion, "If you're really having a hard time walking, you could ask Dromarch to give you a ride..."

His eyes lit up, "**Ohhh, Rex-Rex is genius!**"

Nia looked to Dromarch for his opinion. A Nopon behind his back? "I- think- not. I have solemnly sworn to carry none other than my lady."

Nia urged, "_Go on. It can't hurt._"

Dromarch jumped on his feet with tail raised high, "**WHAAAAATTT?!!!**" Or perhaps, more surprised by her acceptance. He tried to dissuade her, "Are you sure about this, my lady?! If you Tora to ride me now, soon he will want Poppi to join him, and there will be no space left for you!"

![Dromarch raising his tails high](images/170_dromarch_raising_tails.jpg)

"Well, when you put it like that... Sorry, Tora, _guess that's a no._"

"Orgh, Much disappoint...."

Rex worried about "Pyra, are you OK walking?"

"**Oh**, yes, I'm fine. Though all the dust clouds do bother me a little..."

Nia agreed, "Oh, yeah, those are a pain. Gets in your eyes sometimes."

"Poppi also not like that. Small particles get in joints and cause **nasty** creaking when moving. Must ask Masterpon **to clean out** when get out of this place."

"Rex-Rex, it seem like Mor Ardain tricky place for everyone. Rex-Rex have any bright ideas for helping?"

"Well, let's see..."

> Choose: "I could lend out my salvager suits."  
> or: "Just gotta rough it out!"

> (**Choice 1:**) "**Would anyone like to borrow one of my salvager suits?**"

Pyra: "I suppose that would help keep the sand out..."

"I've got a spare you could borrow. You wanna try it on? Actually, I guess Nia's the only one who it would _really_ fit."

"Go on then, I'll give it a try. If it really is useful, we can buy a whole bunch of 'em sometime!"

After wearing it, Dromarch commented, "My lady... That suits you- surprisingly well..."

"Oh shuttup." She was wearing a golden-brown version of Rex's blue ones, including the helmet. "So this is what it's like for Rex when he goes salvaging, huh?"

"Keeps the sand out pretty well, right?"

"Well, yeah, it does that... But I can't really see. Peripheral vision's awful in this thing. It's hard to move about in, too." She tried to do a battle stance. 

Pyra concluded, "It might not be **very** practical for combat..."

"Yeah, I don't think I could fight like this."

Tora concluded, "Looks like genius idea of Rex-Rex _not so genius after all._"

"Well it was worth a try..."

> (**Choice 2:**) He hadn't spoken anything but Gramps read his mind already, "Ahhh, the old 'grin and bear it' solution."

Poppi was disappointed, "Rex not even try to solve problem?"

"Well I mean... listening to you guys talk about it does make me think that the sand and dust is a problem. **But then I realize** it never actually bothered me until you mentioned it. It's not like it's making our attacks miss or anything, **right?** I think we're fighting **as well as we ever have**. It's a bit of an irritation, **but it's not causing any actual problems.**"

Pyra agreed, "I suppose you're right..."

Nia too, "Yeah, I guess its not actually slowing me down."

"Right? So I think as long as we keep our spirits strong, we can make it through this just fine."

Pyra cheered, "**Well said, Rex!** I'll do my best to keep going then!"

Nia: "I'll try and keep my mind off it too."

Of course, everyone had forgotten who had started the conversation and quacked in the first place. Rex suggested, "All right! Let's keep moving, guys!"

Pyra, high in spirit, "**Right!**"

Poppi wondered, "Is this really solution?"

Tora: "Is **best** solution!"

### Mor Ardain vs Gormott

Nia, at Hardhaigh Palace Wing Area #2, commented, "When I look at it now, this capital of yours is pretty prosperous. Far cry from Gormott."

![Mor Ardain Castle](images/195_mor_ardain_castle.jpg)

Mòrag questioned, "Is that how you see it, Nia?"

"Well, am I wrong? Your technology is so much more advanced than Gormott's, and you've got army facilities, hot springs... Looks to me like you've got all you need right here. I guess I don't get why you had to go and annex Gormott..."

"Mor Ardain generally has a rather hot climate, you see. We developed by actively exploiting technology which uses the heat, as well as that we obtained through salvage. **But**... as the Titan nears the end of its lifetime, the temperature has started rising steadily{{footnote: Talk about global warming.}}... Ironically, while this has made our heat-powered technologies even more efficient, our farmland has done very much the opposite- of flourish."

"The Titan's lifetime, huh..."

"Yes, it shouldn't be long now. The day when Mor Ardain's Titan becomes uninhabitable. Sensing that, the Senate started a war to conquer a new home for our people."

"That'd be Gormott, then."

"Indeed."

> Choose: "You realize there was a better way?"  
> or: "All this because of dumb pride..."

> (**Choice 1:**) "You realize there was a better way?"

"Was there, now?"

"Our two governments could've just talked, got to know each other, become friends... **We could've worked together on this! Just- like- you and me**. We were enemies at first, **sure, but now we're allies**, fighting on the same side. If our nations could've done the same, **it wouldn't have had to come to war!**"

"Perhaps so. If everyone in this world thought like you do, terror and strife wouldn't be so commonplace."

"Well, come on... You're not just gonna give up, are you?"

"What do you mean?"

"If there's no need for strife, then we should just get rid of it. **Rex told us,** right? **If we reach the World Tree, there'll be no need for fighting any more.**"

"You think Elysium is the answer to all our troubles, do you?"

"I don't care if people laugh, call it a pipe dream, or whatever. **I'd rather be an optimist** than just despair at the state of the world."

"Hahah! You have a point."

"I hope you'll lend us your strength to reach that goal, Mòrag. It'd be grand if we could count on your support."

"I will! They call me the Empire's finest, and I- intend- to prove it."

> (**Choice 2:**) "All this because of dumb pride..."

"What do you mean?"

She started ranting, "You didn't have to act _so high and mighty. You coulda been humble._ But no. **I dunno if you were refusing to show weakness, or if you just felt you were better than us, but you put your damn pride above all other things and chose to invade.** Am I wrong? You started a war. Wanting to save lives, you ended up losing lives. **How backwards is that?** If you can't make enough food, **why not just... bow your head and ask if you could share?** I mean, we were enemies once, **but now** we understand each other. **How could a sodding government not even think of it?**"

She wasn't angered by it, kept her calm, "A point well made... But the world is not as straightforward a place as that. Sometimes the most- obvious- way is the most difficult to take."

"_Cor..._ People are such a pain..."

"No question..." She didn't realize{{footnote: on the word 'people'}}. That's exactly why I want to support the boy, and other upright people like him.

"You mean Rex?"

"A world with no strife... _Can you imagine something so wonderful, if it were true?_ And if there's anyone who could ever _make it true, it's him._ **_Every age needs its own dreamers to forge new paths,_** after all."

"**Ahah! You're full of surprises, Mòrag.** You always struck me as straight-laced. **But here you are, believing in the Elysium story.**"

"It's not just little boys and girls that follow their dreams, is it? I too want to see the fruits of this dream you all share. _That's why I'm with you._"

"Well, whatever your motive, it's nice to have you with us, Mòrag. Yeah, I think we can make good use of the Empire's finest!"

"Please do! No matter what path we tread, I'll be there to help you on the way..."

### Mòrag the Chef

At the kitchen/restaurant (Rumbletum Canteen) in Argentum, Pyra said to "Hey, Brighid! I found something interesting in that shop over there."

![At the Canteen](images/196_canteen.jpg)

"Interesting?"

"Yep. Here it is." She handed her something. 

"What... is that thing? It looks... quite grotesque."

"Why, that's an Argentum Monkfish." Mòrag recognized immediately, coming into the kitchen. 

"You are familiar with this creature, Lady Mòrag?"

"It's a rare delicacy that is only found in the waters around here. Rather tasty."

"People... eat this monstrous fish thing?" Brighid can't believe what she'd just heard. 

Pyra commented, "It might not look appetizing, but I've heard the taste is divine. Since it's so rare, I thought I'd cook something up with it, but I'm not sure how... Mòrag, do you know? Do tell, please!"

> Choose: "I'm not that great a cook..."  
> or: "...Very well, I'll do it."

> (**Choice 1:**) "I'm not that great a cook..."

Perhaps sensing what's she gonna say, Pyra immediately suggested, "**Oh, no,** that's fine! I'm happy to do the messy part. I just need you to tell me the steps, and then if you could add the spices..."

"Well, if that is all, I suppose it should be... fine..."

Brighid heard the wobbery in her voice, asked, "Are you certain, Lady Mòrag? About the spices and everything?"

"D-d-don't you worry... Have- some- faith in my taste buds."

In front of the stove, they were looking at it. Pyra asked, "Right then. So, first, how should we cook it?"

"_A fine question._ Many would eat it grilled, or sliced raw, **but I hear it tastes best** in a stew."

"**Sounds great!** Well then, Mòrag, can I ask you to get the stock ready?"

"Of course! If I recall, that's- made- by- boiling the guts..."

"I think I can leave you to it then! I'll go buy the other ingredients."

"Roger."

Looking at the fish, Mòrag was self-questioning, "Hmph... **Brighid?**"

"Yes, Lady Mòrag?"

"Do we have to begin by **gutting** this ugly little creature?"

"Well, I should think so. Can you do it?"

She backed a step, "Erm... I'm not even really sure which part the guts are..."

"That would be the parts on the in-side. Consider using a knife..."

"Right... **Brighid?**" After she cut it open, she called out once more. 

"Yes, what is it now?"

She jumped back, exclaimed, "**The heart! The heart- is still- beating!** What should I do? Should I deliver the coup de grâce?"

Can't back away now, she gave the confidence, "I-i-indeed! That- seems wise. We don't want it fighting back."

"**Brighid! It's... looking at me with THOSE EYES, and moving those lips, like it's accusing me of something. IT'S CURSING ME FOR TAKING IT'S heart! It's NO USE... I CAN'T TORMENT the dead any further. BRIGHID, I'll leave the rest to you.**"

"**Wait** just a minute! You can't force me to do your dirty work!"

"**I'M SORRY, but... I must!**"

"Lady Mòrag! Are you deserting in the face of the enemy?!"

> (**Choice 2:**) "...Very well, I'll do it."

Brighid warned for the final time, "Lady Mòrag, if I may. _Is this really- wise?_"

"**Oh!** Don't you worry yourself." She had said it, she must made it come true. 

Pyra was excited, asked, "Shall we start by gutting the fish, then?"

"Ex-cuse me?"

"What's the matter?"

"Gut it? Gut. This. Creature?"

"_Well, yes._ We can't exactly cook it like that."

"**MM HMM!** Understood. Life is a battlefield. Let us commence."

"**Show it who's boss, Lady Mòrag!**" Brighid cheered for her. 

"Mhmph! **Brighid!**"

"Yes?"

"Please hold down its head."

"Wh-wha...?! No, I, er, that is... I'd rather not... touch it."

"**It's just**... a little tricky to make the incision when it keeps... **staring** at me..."

"Qu-quite true, b-b-but..."

"**FOR THE LOVE of the Architect, DO IT! Please, at least cover its eyes for me!**"

"Y-y-yes, Ma'am. We cannot let a mere fish get the best of us! **ERRRRRKKKKK!!!**" She screamed thereafter. 

"**What's wrong?!**"

"**It...It looked me in the eye!** Is this thing still alive?!"

"Can it be? Then I must end it before it strikes!" She pulled out her truncheon, as if the battlefield was even harder than a real one. 

Brighid warned, "**It's opening its foul maw?!** Lady Mòrag, the enemy means to **eat us! Quickly, the finishing blow!**"

"**VERY WELL! HELLFIRE!!!**"

Pyra exclaimed, "**NO, WAIT! I-If you do that, the food will be...**"

But it was too late. They'd destroyed the enemy of their heart that looms larger than it really. Tucked her truncheon back to her sides, she asked, "Well, Brighid?"

She agreed thick-faced, "**As befits the** Flamebringer. _The foe is extinguished... without a trace._"

"Phew. _Our mission here is done._"

Pyra was jumping up and down, "What do you think you're doing?! There's nothing left for us to eat!"

---

### Hot Springs

"Ahh, how Tora missed hot springs. This bring back memories of first time we stay in Mor Ardain." They were at Jakolo's Inn at Mor Ardain. 

![Jakolo's Inn hot spring](images/197_hot_spring.jpg)

Rex exclaimed, "The water here is great, right? It just melted the weariness away."

Mòrag noted, "Ahh, I see. So this is where you stayed."

Zeke: "First time I've been here, though. But hang on... **Is this place unisex?**"

Tora: "Sadly, it is not... Are set times for men and women."

"Ahhh, right... That sorta system..." Discouraged. 

Mòrag: "Hmph... To bad for you."

Tora invited, "Seems now is right time for men to go bathe. **What lads say? We all go, yes?**"

Mòrag jumped on her feet, "What?" I'm not a man?!!!

> Choose: "All men here! No need to fear nudity!"  
> or: "Tora happy to wash everyone's backs!"

> (**Choice 1:**) "All men here! No need to fear nudity!"

Mòrag tried to understand his request, "You want- all four of us- to bathe- together?"

"**Of course yes!** Or, is there some... problem?"

Zeke answered, "No, ummm, me and Rex are game, but urrr Mòrag, uh..." How do one explain? He didn't even notice? 

Mòrag relieved his explanation, "You three go on ahead. I- shall- abstain- for now."

Tora still didn't get it, encouraged strongly, "Mòrag so reserved... **Come on, all go together!**"

Rex asked Zeke, scratching his head, "**Is it possible** that Tora doesn't know Mòrag is a woman?"

Zeke shared his experience the other way, considering the options, "Well, it's not like I could tell a Nopon woman apart, except from the clothing... And with Mòrag wearing **men's** clothes, maybe it's no wonder the little guy got confused. Orrrrr... Maybe he just doesn't really care one way or the other?"

At the center scene, Tora was still trying to convince her, "Mòrag, _it OK! Take moment to breathe, then come with!_"

Straight in his face, "I refuse."

Without listening further, he continued to urge, "Look, _Tora understand. Lots of Nopon not like baths, too._ Maybe- Mòrag afraid Mòrag drown? But- hygiene veeeeeery important! Have to soak, to get nice and clean."

"I **do** like water, and **I am not- filthy**... But on this matter, I will not bulge."

"Ohhh how friend Mòrag be so stubborn, with hot spring right before eyes! **Come on, Mòrag! Drop clothes like man, and jump in hot spring! Tora not have all day!**"

She now ask straight in his face, "You know I'm a woman, _don't you?_"

His fluttering wings froze in mid-air, "Meh... meh... **mehmehmehmehmehmehmehmehmeh?!!!** Wo-wo-wo-**woman?!!!**"

"**Yes. I'm a woman,** Tora."

"**Mehmeh-mehmeh?!!**" He turned around and asked, "**Rex-Rex! Zeke! You know this?!**"

Rex: "I mean, at a glance..."

"Well, for Tora, this discovery of century! **Have to tell Poppi and others!**" After he went away to share the news, the rest gathered in a circle. 

Rex: "well, that's that then, I guess?"

Mòrag: "_My..._ I did not expect **this** when I woke up today."

Zeke suggested, "Hey Mòrag, how about next time you put on a skirt and some heels?"

She replied calmly, "How about you die in a fire, Zeke."

> (**Choice 2:**) "Tora happy to wash everyone's backs! In return, Tora ask for help in washing his! **Tora strong believer in importance of physical contact, for build team bonds!**"

Mòrag: "_I think I'll excuse myself this time._"

"Mòrag not want to bathe with Tora?" He felt disappointed. 

"Please don't take this the wrong way. It is just... **this is a very delicate matter, I'm sure you understand.**"

"Is because Tora is Nopon?"

"**Nooo! Of course not! That's not it at all! I-I just, I have other... Ugh!**"

Zeke now get into the play, "Oh, Mòrag... Why've you gotta be so stubborn? Why not just play along and make Tora's little dream come true?" Or maybe, _your_ dream come true? 

"Bolt it! How dare you make light of me!"

Tora still don't understand, "Mòrag... _maybe worried about feathers in bath?_ Then no need! Tora is younggggg, not drop feathers so easy!"

"Uhm, no, th-that's not the problem..."

"Then there only **one** explanation... _Mòrag really do hate Tora?_"

"Ngh... N-no, that's not true..."

Zeke urged her to reveal herself, "C'mon Mòrag. Tora's almost crying here."

"Urkkk..."

"If Mòrag not hate Tora, then, why not want to wash each other's backs...?"

"**Oh**, for the... **Fine! Let us bathe together!**"

"Huh?" Rex and Zeke jumped on their feet. What the heck is she even speaking? 

Zeke: "Seriously?" 

Only Tora's fluttered wings exclaimed how happy he got. "**Tora score!**"

"But I will bathe in my clothes! And **that**- is non-negotiable!"

Zeke: "Uhhh, good luck trying to explain this to the bath attendants..."

### Rex's Secret Base

He brought Pyra and Nia to his little cove in Fonsett Village. It only have a chest placed on a table, other than the rocks and stones carved by nature. Pyra asked, "So, Rex, you lived here?"

![Rex's little cove](images/198_rex_little_cove.jpg)

"Huh? **Noooo**, this is my getaway. You know, like a _secret_ hideout. I lived on Gramps. I'd moor him next to that cliff over the way."

"What kind of kid were you, Rex?"

"I dunno. I've not really thought about it."

"I bet you're curious too, right Nia?" says she who was showered with excitement. 

She played along a bit, but facing the other direction, "Oh, errr... well, maybe a bit."

Gramps offered, "I could tell you a few stories about when Rex was younger. Ahhhh, yes... He was a wild child, that's for sure. A bit of a tearaway. He was never the biggest child, but he had a strong sense of justice. **Always** picking fights with the local bullies!"

Rex: "I think I still have the bumps to prove it."

Pyra: "So he's been this full of energy his whole life?"

Nia: "Sounds like you were a right handful!"

![Rex's little cove 2](images/199_rex_cove_2.jpg)

Gramps noted, and his storytelling instinct came online, "My my, you certainly _seem interested._ **Well then**, perhaps I'll tell you my **best**- Rex- story."

> Choose: "Whoa, just a sec!"  
> or: "Go on then, I've got nothing to hide!"

> (**Choice 1:**) "**Whoa, wait, just a sec! What do you mean, 'best'?**"

Gramps go forward anyways, and he'll know what it meant by 'best'. "One day, one of the local kids- was attacked- by a monster. _Without thinking, Rex jumped in_ to help him."

Nia noted, "That's our reckless Rex!"

Rex: "**That's your story?** Of course I'm gonna help someone in danger!"

Pyra was eager for more, "**What happened after that?**"

"Both Rex- and the kid- had to be rescued by the villagers."

She was surprised, "Huh? Wasn't- Rex meant to be the one doing the rescuing?"

"That was his plan. Unfortunately, he just ended up in the same hot water."

Nia laughed out loud, "**Hah! Rex, you genius!**"

"That night, I heard Rex- _bawling his eyes out._ Was he in pain from his wounds, I asked. But he replied, 'No, I just wish I'd been able to save my friend.' Injury held no fear for him, but the anguish of not being able to save his friend... was unbearable."

Nia can't understand, "And he cried about that?" 

Looking at him, Rex: "What's the big deal? **Kids cry. It's normal!**"

Pyra: "No, Rex. Nia is impressed! Aren't you?"

"Sure. I was surprised at your bravery. **Even- at- that age...**"

"_We admire you, Rex._" Pyra repeated. 

"**Aw, stoppit! You'll make me blush!**"

Gramps: "_Ho ho ho. I told you it was a good story!_"

> (**Choice 2:**) "**Go on then. I've got nothing to hide!**" he urged. "**Gramps'll just exaggerate it anyway.**"

Gramps therefore teased, "So you won't mind me telling them- about the time you **wet** yourself- when there was a monster attack?"

Everyone jumped on their feet, Rex exclaiming, "**HUH? NO, THAT'S NOT-**"

Pyra already heard it, "W-wet yourself?"

Nia labeled, "Rex, you baby!"

"**That was just when I was a kid! I don't do it anymore! Don't even think about carrying on with the story, Gramps!**"

Nia got excited, "**Awww, c'mon! We wanna hear!**"

He looked for support, "**No! Pyra, pleaseeeee... You don't want to hear it, do you?**"

"_Ummmm... Actually, I kind of do..._"

"**HUH?!**"

Gramps started something unexpected, "This is a story about the time one of the local bullies- fell foul of a monster. _Rex didn't hesitate_. He packed up and..."

"**Gramps, pleaseeeee stop!**"

Nia was still lingering on the thought, "**Is wetting yourself reaaaally that embarrassing?**"

"**SUPER EMBARRASSING!!! Nia, don't tell me it's never happened to you!**"

"Urgh..."

Pyra don't want the fire to burn on her, suggested, "Maybe we should hear a different story."

Gramps got the idea wrong, "Oho, _you'd like to hear an **even** more embarrassing story?_"

Rex: "**No! Stop! Don't encourage him, Pyra!**"

She was confused being misunderstood, "**Huh?** I just want to know as much about you as possible, Rex."

Nia: "Well said! Drivers and Blades should know **everything** about each other."

Rex: "**Yeah, well, there's everything and there's- EVERYTHING. Can we please just drop it?**"
