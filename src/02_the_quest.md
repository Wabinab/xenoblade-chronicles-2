"...and that about covers it. Alllll right, I'll see ya later! **Should** be back in a day or two. **Take it** easy, Gramps!"

"That does not 'about cover it' **in the slightest!** Why would you take a job you know nothing about? You don't even know who your employer is!"

"This came straight from the Chairman, remember? **What more do you need?**" Who's trustable if the chairman, the head of all merchants, whom seek _profit_ at his utmost importance, is not? "**Anyway,** I'm off. You can take a nap while you wait!" He then ran off.

"Gotcha!"

"Why you little!"

"Now look whose mouth's hanging open." 

Malos, Jin, and their blade just watched them played around emotionlessly. Kids are just kids, even if she's a driver and he's sufficiently skilled. 

Then, someone bald wearing salvager suit that looked like a 'standard' bodyguard approached, "Rex, we're heading out. There's no one seeing you off, right? You got night watch. Till then, rest up inside."

"Aye aye. **Later!**" And she leave the girl arguing by herself. 

"Hmph!"
