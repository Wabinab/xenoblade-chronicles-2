# The Architect

===

Descending into the darkness, Nia exclaimed, "The building's holding up well inside."

Tora noticed the technicality, "Quality of structural materials **much** better than in city outside! This made of same substance as World Tree itself!"

"Same as the World Tree?" Rex wondered. The bell dinged once, he then turned around to give the upcoming instruction, when he noticed, "Uh... **Huh? Hey, where is everyone? PYRA! GRAMPS!!!**" No reply. "**Pyra! Mythra!**" There was only a single tunnel, he dashed along it. 

---

Bright light engulfed as he exited the door. He looked around, trying to make do where he was "Uh... **YARRRGH!!!**" Something slammed on him, throwing him to the ground. He heard tidy footsteps marching in the distance. Unable to see them in the darkness, he asked himself, 

"_What is that,_ the Ardainian Imperial Army? But their equipment looks ancient... Like it's coming from the past..." 

His attention wandered, "What is up with this place?" His hand felt around, and he felt something hard and round and smooth. He looked at it closely, "**UWARRRGHHHH!!!**" A human skull. He scanned around him. Skull, skull, and more skull! No piece of land was sacred. He jumped on his feet, "**ARRRGGGHHHHH!!!**" mindlessly ran until a bright light swallowed the environment once more. 

---

Pant, pant, pant. He dashed past rows and rows of tombstones. To his right, there was rows and rows of buildings, lights shining through their windows. He hadn't yet recovered from the shock, he hadn't yet had the attention to wander, not until he stopped, bent over, and catch his breathe. 

He got up once again, the buildings immediately in his sight. He felt there was something present behind him, so he turned around and immediately found Nia and Dromarch. Her ankles were facing inwards towards each other, and she was looking on the floor. Dromarch was in a poaching position, also looking on the floor. 

When you felt shocked and then the relieve came afterward, and you see friends, your brain immediately explain away any inconsistencies. "**Nia! Dromarch! I'm so glad you're...**"

"Why, Rex?" Nia asked, in a depressed tone. 

"**Huh?**" His excitement was cut short. 

"You- told us Elysium **was real!**"

"My Lady and I traveled- allllll this way at _your_ behest. **Master** Rex, did you **intentionally** _deceive us?_"

"I trusted you, you know... **I came here because I trusted you!**"

Rex was perplexed, his heart beating fast, sweat perspire from his palm, he was confused, so confused, "**N-Nia, Dromarch, what are you talking about?**"

"**How do you explain this?!**" Nia jumped on her feet, sniped at him. 

"**Y-you've got it wrong! I told you, I promised Pyra to-**" He tried to explain rationally. 

"**Pyra?** _Oh right, Pyra..._ Pyra... Pyra, Pyra, **Pyra! IS THAT IT?!!! YOU'VE ONLY GOT EYES FOR HER!!! GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ARSE!!!**"

He was on the verge of tears, "**N-Nia, y-you're being weird! What is going on?!!**"

"My Lady has given up _everything_ for you, yet still you realize nothing. Even now, you cannot see." He looked down on the ground, had she? Had he not treated her fairly? Had he not told her he loved her? Was it not she joined because she had nowhere to go after the Gormott event? Sure, they united for Elysium at the beginning, but the drops and precipices _during_ the adventure, had they not enjoyed it? Great fun, companionship? But why? 

"**I'VE BEEN HERE ALL ALONG!!! WHY WON'T YOU REALIZE?!!!**" She cried out desperately. He don't know what to say. "**LOOK!!! JUST LOOK AT ME, REX!!!**"

And she drew out her weapon; he had no choice but to draw out his. 

---

"I... I'm sorry!!!" She laid down, her hand clutched to her injuries. 

She climbed on her feet, forced, "Answer me, Rex! **Why did you lie to us?!**" He jumped a step back. 

"How could you betray our trust?!" Dromarch's voice spiraled into his brain. All he could hear is '_lie_' and '_betray_', and it spiraled in more and more and more, until it fill his whole mind with only those two words. 

He couldn't take it anymore, turned around and ran into the distance, "Aa- **AAAAAAAGGGGGHHHHHH!!!**"

---

Pant, pant, pant. He ran past tall and short metallic pillars (some looked high-tech); his attention was still on 'lie' and 'betray'. He hoped that his feet could brought them away. Once more he was exhausted, stood still to catch his breathe. He still couldn't understand, "Why would... Nia... and Dromarch..."

"You **reaaaaaally** are a fool."

"**AGGGHHH!!!**" Mòrag and Brighid walked closer and closer, and they faced one another. "**Mòrag, Brighid...?**" He just realized where he was standing, scanned the surrounding and recognized, "_Huh?_ Mor Ardain?"

"You're so thoughtless."

"**Mòrag!!**" He turned his attention back to the one speaking after scanning around. 

"**Here** you are, **wasting time, and all the while my countrymen are**..."

Brighid accused, "Do you- have any idea what you've done?"

He grew more puzzled, "Wh... **what do you...**"

Mòrag continued, "**You just run ahead, without a thought for ANYONE ELSE, and THIS IS THE RESULT!!!**"

The floor shook, there was something crashing in the distance he heard. While he was trying to figure out what's going on, "**AGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!**" The ground below him collapsed, taking him with it, into oblivion. 

---

A bright light passed, thud. He reached the ground, he survived the impact. "Urgh..." he returned on his feet, hearing thunderstorms in the background. But Brighid and Mòrag weren't yet gone. 

"I couldn't save anyone. _If only_ we hadn't come here, **I could have saved my people. I COULD HAVE SAVED NIALL!!! IF ONLY IT WEREN'T FOR YOU, REX!!!**" She drew out her truncheon. 

What had this got to do with him? When they came, Amalthus may had controlled Mor Ardain, but it was finally stopped. The collapsing may took some time, but wasn't it her that told him to believe in Niall? That he, an emperor, the one whom willingly risked his life to save his enemy, Queen Raqura, knew what to do at the final moments? Had they confirmed that Niall was dead during the final battle? They know nothing. 

But in the heat of the moment, he tried to convince her, at least calm her down, "M-me? I didn't mean to-"

Brighid sniped, "I _hope_ you're **happy** now. _You've_ **dragged us** to some **EMPTY RUINS!!!**" He froze, and she continued in a second, "I hope that was worth **EVERYTHING WE SACRIFICED!!!**" The battle began. 

---

In a desperate voice, he pleaded, "**Please! Stop this... What's the use of fighting amongst ourselves now?!!!**"

"What's **THE USE?!!!**" Mòrag had an answer for him. "**FOR VENGEANCE!!! WHAT MORE REASON DO I NEED?!!!**"

"**Wha-?!!**" And now it's my fault? 

Brighid agreed, "That's right... **We must take our vengeance... For the thousands of lives you have STOLEN!!!**"

"**I... killed...?!! N-no, wait! I didn't-**"

"I'll have **your life FOR AN APOLOGY, REX!!!**"

Since when did he killed? He don't know, but "**AAAAARRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!**" Once more, he ran for his dear life, unwilling to fight them to the end. She may had accused him, but he cannot accept it, and he cannot fight them. So he ran away. 

"**Stop right there! How dare you run!**"

---

Bright light engulfed the scene, he dashed past absolute darkness, still perplexed with his experience, "What is this place...? What's wrong with everyone...?" 

He stopped once more, looked around and shouted, "**Pyra! Mythra! Gramps!!! Where are you? Where are you guys?!!!**"

But there was no reply. Wherever he looked, he only see darkness and emptiness. He could make nothing out of the environment.
