# Defeating Malos, "I'm Sorry, Rex!"

===

Exiting the room, Rex immediately asked, "**Pyra, where's Malos?**"

"If he is here, I **know** where he must have gone..."

"Where is it? _Tell us!_"

"The _greatest_ of all Artifices. The Artifice that exists **solely** to destroy the world... Aion."

"_Aion...?_ So that's what Malos meant!"

In a dark room with a bridge across a dark pool of water, with dark neon lines running through the side of its path, Malos looked up at Artifice Aion -- the one he found in Pyra and Mythra's memories, the one that Rex saw just before they resurrected and granted him Pneuma's power. 

Rex: "Then **that's where we'll go!**" No time to waste.

The group dashed through the dark room. They reached a room that held an outside view and stopped. Outside, various Artifices Siren aimed their cannons at Alrest and fired their beams. 

On the ground, inhabitants of all Titans watched as pillars of light descended the sky, destroying the City they were living in, killing the people that were just smiling to them seconds ago, and joined them seconds later. The Artifices missed not an inch of the cities. 

Brighid hissed, "Are all of those Sirens...?!"

MÃ²rag only now understood how unwavering his faith was, "He's really trying to destroy all- of Alrest..."

Then, another type of Artifices, the ones similar to those controlled by Malos 500 years ago, descended in groups towards Alrest while Sirens continued firing from space. Rex knew their time was running out, "**LET'S HURRY, GUYYYYSSSS!!!**" They looked no longer.
