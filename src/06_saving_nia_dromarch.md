# Prison Break

"There is Titan warship!" The group was looking from the edge of the town. The ship parked in front of them, tall and huge. 

Gramps: "Mmm. Quite the impressive Titan. Another sign that Mor Ardain... is readying once more for war with Uraya."

Rex glanced at something else, "Look! That root goes **right** to the ship, just like Pyra said."

"Yes, yes!"

"We **should** be able to climb down over here. Let's go!"

Pyra: "OK!"

"Off we go!"

Poppi: "Understood."

Reaching the tip of the root, the group looked up at the duct they were to enter from. "Looks pretty high... Gimme a moment." He shot his anchor up there, against gravity it flew up straight, and stuck to the edge. At one pull, up he went. Pretty handy, eh! Lowering the anchor back down, he called out, 

"Pyra, you first. I'll pull you up, so **hold tight.**"

She was very hesitant. Slowly by slowly, she reached for the rope. As he clicked, he fell to the ground, "Gh... So... heavy!"

With full force, he could not move Pyra up an inch. She already stood herself on the anchor. 

"Wh-what did you say?!" Surprised, she jumped off the anchor, and the rebounce shook him off balance backwards. 

"**YOW!!!**"

Gramps, his guardian, had some lessons for him, "Now look here, Rex. You can't. Just go and call a lady. Heavy."

Tora overheard, "Ooh, Rex-Rex a little tactless..."

Pyra covered her blushing face, "Huh Sorry about that, I guess I was just... surprised!"

Rex was panicking, "**No no, it's not your fault, I-...**"

Tora: "Ooh, she heavier than Tora for sure! **B-but that just mean** Pyra grown to impressive **height! It is good thing!** Pyra should be **proud!**"

Poppi had grown tired of hearing their conversations. Gathering energy on her leg, the boosters powered up, releasing lots of smoke, she zoomed up to the entrance, brought up by her rocket booster, landed with a slam in front of Rex, said, 

"Poppi pull Pyra up. Please... grab again." And she took Rex's anchor and lowered it. Pyra tried once more, very carefully. But she hold tight, hopefully nothing of the sort happening once more.

One step by one step, it moved for sure. 

"Niiice, Poppi."

"Poppi artificial Blade. This is... noooo problem. Poppi could lift Gonzalez if necessary." Well, the blush on her cheeks when she heard herself being compared to a Gonzalez{{footnote: A Giant three-storey tall Gorilla.}}.
