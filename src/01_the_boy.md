# The Boy

===

What world filled with fluffy clouds that spans the entire surface? Deep beneath its surface were infinite pool of water stretching to uncertain depths. A boy in a metallic armor-like diving suit, with headlights guiding his way in this forever-pitch-dark ocean, shot an anchor at the floor, making his way at great speed to a sunken giant bark. There lies a metallic box, weighing against the bark, his target. Locking the magnet on it, he activated the mechanism. Immediately, air filled the hot-air-balloon like balloon, and the metallic crate floats up. He caught hold of it, followed behind. Closer and closer, he could see the dropped anchor. He attached the crate to the anchor, get above it, checked the surrounding, turned off his headlight, before pressing the button that pulled them up. 

The anchor swung and dropped the crate at the back of a floating island; the ground made of greenish muscle and meat. He jumped on the surface; it won't get hurt he's sure, and took off his helmet. "Haaa!" A boy of slightly brown skin, perhaps age 12 or whatnots, and short black hair, revealed himself. "We really do need to buy ourselves a new depth probe... The ping was off by 150 peds to the east. That's not gonna fly!" As he speak, he detached the anchor from the crate. 

On the little 'island' were also some potted plants, some line hanging clothes, a small cabin, and some barrels, plus other small objects. 

"And what about the treasure, **Rex**? Was it in line with your expectations?"

Rex took a metallic object with two curved thongs and walked towards the crate, answered, "It seemed pretty solid. Didn't even have to reinforce it too much. **Even with the labor costs,** we should be able to turn a decent profit." He tried to find a weak point on the crate. 

"Honestly, it takes you two days to run the structural analysis... Yet somehow you can gauge the profits in an instant?" The one's speaking was the 'island' itself. It, a giant monster, raised its head and turned around to look at Rex on its back. On its neck, unlike its back, grown the green flurry feathers, and the neck stony-like scales. There were stony-looking of stone-colored and some deep-purple-colored opening-up plates on its head, and a horn. 

"Don't go rainin' on my parade, **Gramps.** You know I'm in the salvaging trade- for- the- **cash!**" He found the weak spot and bang hard on it with the tools he had, and pulled while speaking with difficulty, "A little business **sense**... goes a long **way, all... right?**" 

There finally it budged. "**Whoa!**" Water sprayed out of the box and knocked him backwards. Alas, his treasure sense did indeed brought back a treasure monster -- a blue lobster that doesn't look at all friendly. "**I didn't expect THAT! You been living** in this thing, big guy?"

Not that it would hear his talking; he had to dodge an attack from it. 

"Rex!"

"No worries, Gramps!" While the monster was preparing for the next attack, he quickly went into the cabin and took his sword before facing head to head the lobster. "I think we know what's for lunch!"

---

Rex narrated, "An entire horizon of white. A sea of clouds, and at its heart, the World Tree, piercing the heavens... This... This is the world we call home... Alrest." Oh, and he put the lobster onto the stove fire. 

"Story goes that when the world was young... Everyone in Alrest lived on the Tree, together with our divine father, the **Architect**. According to the tales, it was a bountiful land. And the people there held the power to command even the heavens themselves. They called that _paradise..._ 'Elysium'. But then, one day... we were cast out. Nobody knows why. Perhaps we angered our creator, or perhaps it was something else **entirely**..." 

While that was cooking, he went back to the box to search for anything profitable. After taking out everything useful, he lowered the crate back into the ocean beneath the cloud sea.{{footnote: 落叶归根}} What's not useful he dump them in a bin. And he opened up the roof of the cabin and let lights in.

"All we know is we were forced to leave Elysium to live here, in Alrest. Where it turns out, life was pretty hard. But when it seemed like we would surely die out, the Architect... took pity on us... sending his servants, the Titans, to save us. The few of us who survived... settled on the Titans... and, we've lived in harmony with them ever since. But now, those Titans... are beginning to die out."

There, the crusty lobster pincher looked roasted and cooked. 

"Aarrrrggghhhh... The brazier does my weary old bones much good..."

"You want me to move it, Gramps?"

"No, that's quite all right. Leave it right there... _aaaaahhhhhh_..."

"Righto." And there he had his bites on the delicious. Until an emergency-sounding alarm beeped far beyond the cloud sea. He stood up, looked in awe; Gramps was also alerted. A Titan of whale-like shape leaped from below the cloud sea. There was a light-blue crystal on its head that blinked slowly repeatedly before it died down, and the titan sunk back down to sea bed. The wave sent at them shook Gramps, and he had to hold on tight. But nothing had been feeling more sad to see a Titan died before their eyes. Even his tone died down. "Not another one... Been happenin' a lot lately..."

"Mm... More so than before."

"I wonder... if anyone was living there."

"I-it seems not. And if there had been, they would have all left by now."

"Makes sense." But a feeling of relief does not come. If they die out one by one, will the ones still living have place for them to move in? And what if the place they move in were also at the end of their lives? "Hey, Gramps, d'you think... Fonsett Village will be gone **too** one day?"

"It would not be today, or tomorrow, but one day, _yes, it will fall..._"

"And you too?"

"That's how it goes with us Titans... There's- no- way- around it."

"Eventually... there'll be nowhere left to live."

"_Sadly..._"

He turned around and looked at the single bark that stretched high up into the sky in the distance. "So... You Titans were born up there, is that right?"

"So they say, for what it's worth." He turned his head on that tree too, but corrected him, "Mind you, I was born here, on Alrest. As for my ancestors, who could say, where they were born..."

"Can it **really** exist? This Elysium? And the creator, who's said to live there..." Do they even have hope? Can they, they exiled, be allowed to go back to the Land of the Heavens, if it exists? 

"A land of plenty, atop the World Tree... If such a place did exist, perhaps we could all live in peace... with no need for fighting."

"Sure would be great." Except it's too far away. "For everyone... even folks in Fonsett. If the divine Architect can see us now, I wonder what he thinks..." The World Tree, its top, is layers upon layers of leaves that form concentric rings in different layers, generic view from afar form an imperfect sphere. Smaller branch just before such sphere exists, forming short small platforms.

He did some stretches, pushed away all the sadness and worries, slapped both side of his face, and cheered up. "**All right!** Back to making money!" He checked the dustbin, suggested, "**I think** this haul should be enough for today. **Oi, Gramps!** Care for a little swim to the Argentum Trade Guild?"

"**You're planning** on selling it now? Urgh... It's getting toward _my bedtime..._"

"Don't play the lazy old man with me. There's **plenty of sunshine** left!"

"_Kids these days... **No** respect, I swear..._"

---

> **Translator's note on environment:** Bazaar lined the sides of the rights of way inside a giant hall. People were walking, looking, trading; merchants were usually Nopons. The decorative lights lured customers to visit their stores. The guild is a ship strapped to a giant floating puffer-fish-like TItan, with smaller size puffer fish also strapped below it as extra force. This, is **Argentum Trade Guild.** 

---

"Why, if it isn't Rex! How's business?" He had Gramps docked at one of the ports, and he unboarded himself. 

"Going al right, else I wouldn't be here."

"Fair point. So, which one am I unloading?"

"We can leave that until I'm done _negotiating_. Shouldn't be too long!"

"Well, mooring is 15 gold per half-day."

"I'll have your gold after I sell the stuff, all right? Later!" And he already ran off to the guild hall. 

"**Hey, hold on! You know I can't do credit...** _Urgh, He does it every time, too..._" Then, he turned to look at Gramps. Big eyes looking at small eyes. 

"No wallet, I'm afraid..."

"Figures..." he scratched his head. He can only wait. 

---

Meanwhile, before Rex entered the guild hall, one of the ship parked at the port caught his eyes. It was metallic, looking like a battleship. "Awesome... This thing's huge, and it's not even a Titan ship!"

---

At one of the stores, Rex was speaking to the Nopon behind the desk. "**WHAT, THAT'S IT?!!!**"

"**Is life**, meh! This still more than I give to non-friend! If you bring **military supplies**, then you get **good price**! Ceasefire between Mor Ardain and Uraya not keep for too much longer, methinks. So weaponry is hot item!" Soldiers were already keeping themselves at the guild, shopping for supplies at the other bazaar. "Well? What **friend think?** I make it worth your while!"

"I told you before, I stay away from that sorta thing."

"Ohhhh, is shame! Rex good salvager, could be good way to earn pretty penny! **Waste of talent**, if you ask me! **Anyhoo, where were we?**"

"I'll take your offer. 200 now, and you know what to do with the rest."

"Okie doodles! Sending monies to, Corinne of Fonsett Village. **Is right?**"

"Yeah."

"Is beautiful thing! Sending money home at such young age. **I touched! Wish my own dum-dum** littlepon did same!"

"It's 'cos Gramps doesn't **charge rent, hehe.** All right, I'm countin' on ya!"

"**Roger! Pleasure doing business!**" He already walked away. 

---

Two human-like bodyguards of a Nopon walked down the stairs and called out, "Hello, Rex!"

"Pupunin! Been a while!"

"Rex looking high spirits! Ah, no, how say... Yes, **peppy**!"

"**Been worse! So**, you got something for me? New job maybe?"

He nodded, "Mmm something like that. Ah, by the way... Rex come from Fonsett Village in Leftherian Archipelago, yes?"

"Yeah, that's right. Why d'you ask?"

"Y-you should go straight to boardroom of Chairman!"

"**Wait, what's** going on?"

"Chairman Bana, ask for Rex, by name!"

"The Chairman? **For me?!**"

---

Bana is a giant Nopon wearing every single luxury goods that showed how luxury he is. Golden rings encasing giant ruby crystals; even one attached as an eyepatch. Multiple necklace of expensive braces. And a hat that make him looked like pirate. The Green Nopon, upon Rex entering, spoke with strong speeches, "Thank you, for accepting summons! I, Bana, Chairman of Argentum Trade Guild."

"P-pleased to make your acquaintances..." He looked to his right, found a beautiful girl that looked at him with her nostrils. To his left, another one, but less showing her 'higher-up' status. 

"Me hear from Pupunin that friend is salvager of some, renown. That being case, I have, teensy weensy thing, to ask of Rex!"

"A request straight from the Chairman?!" Rex felt excited, hadn't sensed a difference in atmosphere. 

"Reward is, 100,000 gold."

"A hundred thousand?!"

"Friend hear right! _Actually_, **that**, just the advance. Another 100,000 provided upon _completing job._"

"**200,000 gold in total? I-I must be dreaming...** I'll do it. I hereby swear to use every skill I possess to ensure this job is successful! I promise I won't let you down! **Hahahahah!**" So much gold, how much it would ease those back in Fonsett Village! 

"You agree, without even hearing **details** of job?"

"Oh, oh, right... Um... What kind of job is it?"

"You really _have skills for this?_"

"Of course, I'll be fine!"

"Meh, if you say. Here, crew will explain the task. Bring them in." Not that he could find that many willing people _fast_!

"Sir." The high-nostril woman turned around and opened the door behind her. She walked out for a while before leading them back in. First came a cat-eared girl around his age wearing orange cold sweaters with fair skin and some drawings on her face like those of ancient tribes. Beside her, her companion, a white tiger, followed her into the room. Behind her was a strict-looking guy wearing black armor of black short hair gelled up; his thick eyebrows doesn't make him look like a nice guy. The final guy with neck-long white hair, wearing a half-mask that covered only till his nose, with a katana behind his back. 

In shocking eyes, he exclaimed, "Drivers...? And... Blades?! Whoa! They look so cool!"

"So... There's something that we want to haul up." The white-haired guy got straight to the point. "There were some current shifts. It showed up in an uncharted area. But it's a looong way down."

"Nice... I like a good challenge!" His excitement did not struck any chord in the white-haired guy. 

"Bana offered to assemble team of **veterans** _for this job._ But this crew veeery picky. They want small elite team and only from Leftheria. **That** when Bana have _stroke of genius!_ Should hire **Reeeeexxxx!!!**"

"**Hah ha!** You made the right choice!"

"Thhh... Um hmmm..." The girl couldn't help but laughed at his 'idiocy'. "A child salvager? **Jin**, don't tell me we're gonna have to hire some **babysitters** for this outing too."

"**What the hell?** You look as much like a kid as I do, lady!" Already he pointed his fingers back to her unpleasant commands. 

"At least I wouldn't **wet** myself at the promise of a measly hundred grand!"

"What're you tryin' to say?!" He walked forward as if about to pick a fight. Her tiger got between them, and out of fear he took steps backwards. How anger clouded one in forgetfulness that she's a driver. 

"Ahem... Rex, was it?" asked the tiger. "I implore you to excuse, my lady's discourtesy." It, he, bowed his head to Rex. 

"**Dromarch!** What have I told you about speaking for me? Shut your..."

"Drop it, Nia." The guy that came behind him cut her off, feeling impatient. "Though I do see your point. In any case... It should be easy enough to make sure..."

"What?!" And her body grew larger in front of him as swords were slashing at him. Reaching the edge of Bana's table, he drew his sword and blocked the guy's; but his full force only equaled his simple hold. "Ugh!" That broke his defense, but it's enough to prove his skill. "What're you playing at?!"

"Well well well..."

Nia was shocked as well, "**Malos!** What good is it beating up a kid?"

"You said it yourself, didn't you? What if the kid's not up to it?"

"I said nothing of the sort!"

"You **did think** it though, right? And anyway, now we know. You'll do right enough. Though you _don't look_ like a Driver..." He was still holding his defense, even when Malos already sheathed his weapon. "Where'd you learn those Arts?"

"Gramps showed me a thing or two. Even when I was little, that was **his** idea of playtime."

Not that he cared. "Well, you've got some skill, I'll give you that. Guts, too. **Kid**, you better work hard." He and Jin then left the room. One of the blades that looked like a monster with tails followed Jin, leaving the room. 

"Hugh..." Whatever, she don't even look at him, walked out behind them. Dromarch gave a bow before following behind. 

Bana had headache, "**Meh-meh-MEH! Friends are such rowdy bunch!**" From his pocket, he tugged out a big sack of gold, bang it on the table. "Here is advance. **Use to buy** what gear you need, then go to dock, on starboard! Bana has arranged, excellent vessel _for you there._"

"You got it." All the excitement from such money had drowned at such dangerous a party. If he had not learned, his would have leave the room with his body dragging a line of blood behind, dumped into the infinite cloud sea below, and became feast to some passing Titans. Not that he would leave right now that he accepted. He needed the money anyways.
