# Tantal

===

Indol. Docking port. The Uraya and Mor Ardain ship had already left. Mòrag returned yet again from Mor Ardain and found the group awaiting for their ships. She explained and concluded, "So that's how it is. It seems our paths continue to entwine."

Rex was impressed, "**That's awesome news!** To be honest, I was really hoping there was some way you could... stick around. I was just thinking of asking you myself."

"Saved you the trouble, did I?"

"**That you did!** Thanks a bunch, Mòrag!" He held out his hand for her to shake. And she took it. 

---

The Urayan ship was still on its way, crusing home. Her 3 bodyguards gathered behind her, at the front of the dock. The Queen was still thinking, "I can't help but feel that in all the **confusion** surrounding Bana, our concerns... have been neatly swept aside."

One of her muscular bodyguards with glasses, green hair, and moustache all around his chin that stretches up to his ears commented, "The Praetorium maintains **absolute** control over Blade distribution. It is **quite** vexing..."

Another of her male bodyguard without glasses, wearing mermaid-like suits, added known info, "Awakening rates from natural cores are very low, which limits the pool of compatible *Drivers*."

The Queen summed up, "So, to create **large** numbers of Drivers, the cleansing Indol provides is a necessity. That much I am willing to accept. The **real** problem, is the fact that the Aegis has awakened. This is no time to be squabbling over **territory**. If we **misread** the situation **eeeeven** a little, Uraya itself could be sunk to the Cloud Sea's bed. Emperor Niall must **surely** be thinking the **same thing!** That's why he sent his **precious** Mòrag, to shepherd them along."

The first bodyguard added, "**And now**, we find ourselves in their debt..."

"Who could have predicted _such an act of selflessness_? Was it just the passion of youth, or was it...?"

"M-my liege?"

She changed the topic; that's something to think about. Politically, one could do about anything, but sincere emotions isn't usually one of them. "In any case, for now, we should keep our troops mobilized while we monitor the situation. I hardly expect Tantal will **comply** with the Praetor's plans so easily, either..."

---

On a ship powered by a small dragon Titan, Rex was daydreaming alone on the side deck; the vast cloud sea served as a drawing board for his imagination. Zeke found him and immediately shot a question to him, "**Say, chum. Which one d'you fancy, Pyra or Mythra?**"

"**Uhhhhh, Zeke!** You can't just ask someone... **Anyway, they're the same person!** I've never really thought of them separately..."

"**Are you serious? But they're like,** totally different characters. Like, Mythra is- **jolly** intense. And Pyra is just totally mellow, or, I dunno... What's the opposite of- 'pushy'?"

"On the outside, maybe. But... Pyra's got a lot of backbone too. She can be pretty stubborn!"

Zeke was impressed that "You seem to understand them _pretty deeply._ Well, I suppose you ARE their Driver."

The sea was quiet, and nothing in particular went into their mind for a moment, and they just enjoyed the breeze. But it wasn't long, "**Hey!**"

"Yeah?"

"**You're a**- prince- from Tantal, aren't you, Zeke? Why were you in the Praetorium?"

"**I mean, you can't just ask someone...**"

Pandoria appeared from nowhere, heard 'right what you did to me' and his denial to answer, and she revealed it without giving him a piece of cloth to cover himself, "**Oh, his old man** kicked him out!"

He turned around hastily and shouted, "**OI**, no! Bad Blade, bad! How long have you been standing there?"

"From about... 'which one d'you fancy'..."{{footnote: And they didn't even heard her footsteps, nor see her from the side of their eyes? Wonderful!}}

"'Which one d'you fa...' **That's the whole conversation!**"

She disregarded that, turned to Rex and continued _his_ story, "As I was saying, **my Prince got disowned** by his father. **He spent all his time traveling the world for fun,** instead of attending to his studies. Then **BYEEEEE!!!**"

Zeke rebutted, "**It wasn't for fun! I was learning all about,** uh, **society and international relations!**"

She laughed at that, "**'IIIInternational relations,'** that whatcha call it?"

"**OI, CAN IT, YOU! What are you doing anyway**, dissing your own Driver?!"

"**HAHAHAHAHAHAH!!! You guys crack me up!**"

Pandoria: "I love him really."

"_Awwwww_! Anyway, he sounds tough. Zeke's dad, I mean."

"Tantal is an isolationist society. Crossing its borders without leave is strictly forbidden. It's been that way for ages now."

"Ohhhhh, hmm..."

"But, you've seen how my Prince here is. **Couldn't stop himself** leaving a few times, so he got chewed out and disowned. **Back when** he was... fifteen or something?"

Zeke agreed, "**YEAHHHHH, something** like that."

"Then the Praetor himself found him half-dead on the ground one day, and took him in. _He made up that 'special envoy' stuff._" She loudly whispered to Rex. 

Rex: "And that's... how you ended up in **Indol. It all makes sense now!** Oh but wait... Is it **safe** for you to go back to Tantal, then?"

Zeke: "**This time** we've got official **business** from the **Praetorium**! It'll be fine. _Probably._ **Besides...**"

"Yeah?"

"**Tantal is too ignorant** of the outside world. **It needs** a wake-up call."

Just then, a soldier, or perhaps a worker from the Praetorium, approached Zeke and informed, "Sire! We have reached the designated coordinates. Please."

"**RIGHT! READY?**"

Pandoria: "**You betcha!**"

Rex was confused, "Huh?"

"**Shut up and sit down, chum. THIS'LL BE GREAT!**"

---

The group gathered at the front deck, and Pandoria at the edge of the hull. Her core crystal pointed below the cloud sea, shone a beam that strike deep down. A tornado started forming, slowly but surely. 

---

Tantal. Central hall. It started shaking, and the room brightened. The central hall looked old, with various buildings dating perhaps millennium. Flames within cage kept the Castle at minimum warmth. Ether flowed through the pillars, strengthening them. Someone approached and informed the king, whom was sitting on his stone chair, "My lord. Genbu has begun surfacing."

![Tantal's hall](images/238_Tantal.jpg)

He voice weak, "_I am aware. It's Pandoria._"

"Then the Prince..."

"_Yes._"

"We **have** received _reports_... that he made contact with the Aegis in Indol."

"_So after 500 years, he makes his move... Praetor Amalthus._"

![Zeke's dad](images/239_zekes_dad.jpg)

"My Lord?"

"**We must act.** To protect our _days of peace_. Even if they are a dream- _that cannot last..._"

---

Genbu finally floated to the surface upon calling. The group was awestruck by its appearing. But he was certain -- soon, they would reach the World Tree.

![Genbu 1](images/240_genbu.jpg)

![Genbu 2](images/241_genbu_2.jpg)

Nia still remembered _that_, noted, "_Whoa..._ It's just like a bigger version of Turters..."

Zeke was playing with Turters on his palm while explaining, "It's called- Genbu. **It's the same, like**, Titan-type of Uraya. Normally, it's submerged in the Cloud Sea."

Pandoria added, "Even in early fall, it can get pretty cold inside Tantal. **Mind you don't freeze!**"

Nia already imagined her journey, "Brrrr.... I really can't stand the cold..."

Brighid offered, showing off her blue flames on her palm, "I can provide my own warmth. You can stay close to me if you like."

"Me as well." And Pyra replaced Mythra, lighting her flames. 

Nia was impressed, "You guys are **pretty handy** to have around."

"Well it is our trademark, right?"

Brighid agreed with her, "Essentially."

Nia turned to look at Zeke. Still wearing his thin shirt that show his bare naked chest, wondered, "Aren't you gonna be cold like that, Shellhead?"

"**I'm used to it!** I'll be dandy."

Pandoria revealed, "He's naturally dense. It's good insulation."

Rex and Nia agreed, in unison{{footnote: Actually, a little bit out of unison but let's not dwell on that.}}, "Oh, makes sense!"

Zeke: "**Stop encouraging her, gang of bullies!**" Meanwhile, the ship cruised towards Genbu as it awaited its Prince's return. 

---

Everlasting snow piled thick on the mountainous interior of Genbu. Blizzard would appear the next day if it don't today. Only trees capable of retaining liquid water in their trunks survived the freeze. Ice acted as a layer of protection to the cliff walls. An old-looking building, powered by Ether along its veins, stay preserved from freeze erosion. Only the blood of its royal family can open the insignia that sealed the door to its relatively empty interior. This, is the **Kingdom of Tantal.**

![Tantal](images/242_tantal.jpg)

---

The group walked along, but Nia? She literally hugged Pyra's whole arm, dragging along, eyes closed. Pyra was feeling _quite_ uncomfortable and asked softly, "_H-hey_, Nia... Do you, um, mind...?"

![Nia leaning on Pyra](images/243_nia_leaning_on_pyra.jpg)

"Heheh, c'moooon, it's not so bad. You're just so warm, I can't help it!" And she rubbed against her a _little_, ahem, yes, just _a little._ She dropped her hugs on her arms. 

The group had stopped and watched them, with Gramps explaining the physics, "It's a function of what's known as 'infrared radiation'."

"Gramps knows everything."

Pyra felt innocent, "I'm... _not your personal heater, you know..._"

"M-my lady... If you desire warmth, why not take some from **me**? Miss Pyra seems to be in some distress..." offered Dromarch.

Nia immediately rejected the notion, "**No way!** Your fur is all **stiff and spiky** with the cold, it'd be **murder** on my sensitive skin."

"**But, my lady...**" He don't know what to say. 

But there was something else on the walls that attracted her attention, "**Hey, is it just me, or are the ether lines really dim?**"

![Ether lines](images/244_ether_lines.jpg)

Poppi's [curiosity](/96_heart_to_heart.html#poppis-unending-curiosity) shot up immediately, asked, "What is meaning of- 'ether lines'?"

"**Y'know, those things**, the glowing threads that run inside a Titan."

Dromarch explained, "That is the glow... of pure ether coursing through the Titan's body. You can compare it to the **bloodstream**- of a human."

Zeke praised, "You've got good eyes! **Genbu has-** pretty- **bad-** circulation, compared to other Titans. They **say**, it's **why** we have a cold climate, and awful crops."

Rex concluded, "So it's... cold-blooded?"

"**Heh!** Call it what you like."

---

They stood before the bridge that lead to the entrance to Theosoir, the city of Tantal. It was like a castle, but the top floor no longer guarded; though, despite having no visitors, 2 soldiers stood by each side of the front door, guarding its entrance. 

![Theosoir](images/245_theosoir.jpg)

Mòrag was impressed, "_Oh, my..._ This- is the very picture of the ancient civilizations I've read about!"

Zeke expanded on it, "It's a pretty classic look. You know the old land of Torna? They had a proud and noble civilization, rivaled **only** by Judicium at the time. **But**, whereas Judicium- were the masters of- _biological_- arts, Tornans knew all there was to know about engineering. The **proud blood** of Torna- runs in the veins _of us Tantalese._"

Dromarch added, "As there are people to pass it on to, civilization will endure. Knowledge is inherited, much like life itself."

His driver was impressed, "Nice quote! You should write that down."

"Thank you."

Zeke: "It's not that simple, though."

Rex wondered, "**Huh?**" 

He's not explaining, "You'll see..."

---

Immediately entering the city, a square at the center with bazaar and shops. Giant bowl supply fuel for the flames that lit the dark world, and provide heat from afar. The trading seems similar to ancient Arab market civilization, decorating their entity with beautiful rugs where they welcomed their customers, their produce piled in sacks within the three-legged tent. Pillars around the square with ether gathered at their tip, arranged like Stonehenge around the circumference, directed towards a center obelisk. Along the top of the central obelisk, ether drained from the bottom shot a beam high up into the air. 

![Market](images/246_market.jpg)

Nia's first impression is its market, "**Whoaaaa**, that's a pretty lively market."

Zeke quietly introduced, "_It's the black market._"

"**Black**- market?"{{footnote: Why, does the black market can be put up in the open? We'll see later.}}

"**Tantal is so cold**, there's precious little in the way of local produce to sell. Just look. All the regular shops are shuttered." Proper buildings to their left were uninhabited, their doors closed down with wooden planks. 

"You're right, they're mostly empty." Rex agreed. 

"Instead, folks pay **ungodly** prices... for produce that's been smuggled in from other nations. And since it's the only thing keeping people from _actually_ starving, the bigwigs just turn a blind eye."

Brighid questioned, "So, most of the agricultural production is wasted **just surviving**, and the country grows weak..."

"Exactly."

Mòrag concluded, "So even the wisdom of a _proud_ ancient civilization... _cannot solve all problems..._"

"**Ancient civilization** sounds- **good** and all... But basically, this place is a giant museum, _with no tourists_. That's not gonna feed anyone." He led on their journey. 

---

Up the stairs just behind the square, the path led towards Theoscaldia palace. The servants of the royal family that earlier spoke to the king was waiting for them. "We have been expecting you, Your Highness."

"**Yeah, yeah. Good to see ya.** Is the old man inside?"

"Indeed. He has been **eagerly** awaiting your return."

"**HAH!** Now I know you're lying. **Armus will fly** before that man welcomes me home. No need to coddle me, mate."

"Apologies."

"Any case, **seems he knows we're coming,** that'll save time." The servant therefore turned around and led the way. 

Mòrag was traversing when she noticed one of these pillars with ether at their tip. The ether that gathered within was so intense, locked inside the cogwheels. She seemed to recall... where does she saw it last time, in this history book? "_Could it be..._"

Brighid wondered why she's immobilized. "Are you all right?"

"_Yes._" She shook her head, shook away the thoughts. But if that's true, she needs to do something about it. Not herself, though; she'd attract too much attention, given her title. Tora and Poppi were catching up with the group when Mòrag turned around and quietly called, "_Tora..._" She bent down and discussed whatever they were speaking; only those 4 knew whatever. 

After she finished, Tora don't understand, "_Uh... but why? It true Poppi able to produce own reserves of ether energy, but..._"

"I'll explain later. For now, just do as I ask."

"All right then. **Leave it to Tora!**"

---

The door opened and those young guys (Rex, Pyra, Nia, especially) were flabbergasted by how tall the hall were. The older ones (like Mòrag and Brighid) don't even care a second. Tora was still busy with the job Mòrag had handled him, don't have time to enjoy the scene. On both sides of the hall, soldiers wielding spear stood. Zeke and Pandoria came in first, leaned on one of the short decorating pillars filled with ether fluid. The king sat on his chair, as always, waiting for their arrival. The servant stood beside the king. 

Mòrag lead the front, took off her hat and bowed before the king. The servant explained her identity. Brighid and the rest already bowed, well except for Rex, whom still looked around what the rest of the group were doing.{{footnote: Tora not bowing because he's a potato.}} Rex conformed to the group's expectations. 

Zeke watched the servant stood before Rex as he handed him with both hands the official letters from Amalthus. The servant took it with one hand, and the curious Rex watched as he walked back up the stage and handed it to the king. 

He first focused on Pyra, "_The Aegis... I presume._" Only then he turned his eyes on the manuscript. 

"**Uh?**" They were alerted when the king tear the manuscript into pieces, lay it to scraps before their eyes. 

The anger within Zeke strike up to max, "**HUH!!!**" And the soldiers rounded the group. 

"**Guards?! MY LADY!**" The group already stood up in a circle, back to back. 

Tora felt scared, "**Meh meeeehhh??**"

Nia: "**Wh-what the hell is going on? Shellhead?!**"

One of the guard hugged him and Pandoria. He was struggling to free himself from his grip. "N-**no idea! Stop this at once! DAD!!!**" He shoved the soldier aside and shouted at his old man. 

The old man raised his hand. A fork on the ceiling gathered electricity and strike right at Pyra, "**AAAAAARRRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!**" 

"**GRRRRRAAAAAHHHHHH!!!**" Rex felt the pain she felt. 

Nia: "**Rex!**" 

Then, a prison fell from above her and imprisoned her. The rings formed around her limbs, sealed her powers, and she went unconscious. The prison floated back up and floated behind the king to unknown destination. 

![Pyra imprisoned](images/248_pyra_enchained.jpg)

"**Pyra!**" Rex was to went for her when 2 guards blocked his way, used the back of their spear and held around his neck, pressed him down. "**Le-Let her go! Pyra! PYYYYYRAAAAAA!!!**"

Zeke went in front of Rex, faced the king, angrily shouted, "**STOP THIS MADNESS!!! WHAT'S GOING ON?!!!! REX and his lot HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING!!!**"

The king stood up from his seat, said, "We cannot afford to wait until they doooooo, Zeke. **The world must not be allowed to burn.** _The Aegis must be destroyed!_"

![The Castle](images/247_the_castle.jpg)

Nia: "Oh, no, you don't. Dromarch, let's get Rex outta there!"

"Roger!" They dashed towards the two soldiers and swing her rings at him when the ether on the surface of the ring got sucked away. 

Nia was surprised, "**The ether energy! ARRRRGGGHHH!!!**" The soldier took the chance and lanced at her, felling her. 

"**My lady! AURGHHH!!!**" The pillar of lightning strike once more and disabled Dromarch. 

The king instructed, "Please, do not resist. My goal is only... to destroy the Aegis. I have no wish to take your lives also."

Mòrag called out calmly, putting back his cap, "King Eulogimenos. I stand before you, as a **special envoy** of Mor Ardain. The Emperor sent me here **himself. Do you realize** what you are doing?"

"I am quite aware. And **prepared** to face the consequences."

"_Prepared...?_" So this had all been planned. 

---

All had been brought down. Only the king, the servant, Zeke, and Pandoria left in the room themselves. "**WHY? WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BUMP PYRA OFF?**"

"**I see you speak like a commoner.**"

"**WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING? DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT!**"

"**What if** I told you I act for justice?"

His eyes squinted, "_What are you trying to say?_"

"You could say... I'm doing this for Alrest."

"Say **WHAT NOW?**"

"Follow me."

---

Zeke found himself inside a room carpeted with those Arab rugs the merchants used earlier. Piles and piles of crates and barrels, and some vases and jars and paintings and scrolls and jewelries, piled on top of one another. All had the imprints of the Royal family sigil on them. The king stood beside him, waiting for the shocked Zeke to take it in, "**Th-this is...**"

"This is... the legacy of our royal line."

"_You can't be_ **serious...**" His rage flood his chest. The more he tried to suppress, the more his anger burn. "**WHY??? FATHER, WHY?!!!**"

His old man dropped his head in slight guilt. What dad would have disappoint their son? What dad acts as anti-role-model for their son?
