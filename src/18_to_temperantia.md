# Off to Temperantia, Encounter with Jin

===

The group met Amalthus and Haze at the Audience Chamber. Amalthus briefed them, "As you may know, there is a demilitarized zone between Mor Ardain and Uraya. Temperantia. Think of it as a buffer between the two nations. We've received word of- _fighting_- in the area. Mor- Ardain- are in possession of a _Titan_ weapon. They're advancing as we speak towards the Urayan garrison."

"**Impossible!**" Mòrag hadn't heard about any instruction from the Emperor for attacking Uraya, nor does she believe her brother would make such a choice. 

"Well, the two countries' Titans are at their closest right now..."

"**You're saying we were WAITING for a chance to strike? Unthinkable! Our people would NEVER go to war against His Majesty's will!**"

Brighid urged, "At any rate, we must investigate."

"_Yes... You're right._ Praetor, I beg your leave. We need to find out what's going on. Your Eminence."

"Thank you." And she and Brighid left the room. 

"Your Eminence, we..." Rex was beginning to ask when Amalthus get to the point, 

"Might I ask you to assist Special Inquisitor Mòrag- in her investigation?"

Pyra accepted it at once, "We have no reason to refuse. **And** you- needn't worry about me."

"I am quite grateful to hear that."

Rex urged, "**Let's go** after them, hurry!" And they left the room. Fan gave her bow, despite them no longer looking.

Senator Roderich, in his living quarters with the soldiers, was enraged, "**Who?! Who's responsible for this?! Preparations are still ongoing,** if we attack now, we could-"

Mòrag immediately walked in with Brighid, "**What, have you done, Senator Roderich?**"

"Special Inquisitor?! What are you doing here?"

She didn't have the obligation to answer him, continued, "**The Emperor ordered that the dig be halted.** He was VERY specific, Senator. If you've restarted it, you have **violated- His Majesty's will.**"

He argued, "The Emperor doesn't understand Mor Ardain's urgent lack of resources. **This is** for the Empire."

Mòrag shook her head, cannot agree, "Your patriotism is touching. But **that** doesn't explain why you're waging war **with Uraya!**"

"It wasn't me! I did not give that order! Even **I** would never **dream** of... declaring war without His Majesty's express consent!"

"So **who** in the..."

"Mòrag!" Rex was running into the room with the others. 

Roderich was upset, "**Who... who are these people?! Bursting in here?**"

Mòrag introduced, "This- is the Driver of the Aegis. You are to afford him the same respect as me."

"_This is him?!_ I'd heard the rumors, but this **boy**..."

Rex was more concerned and impressed with "There are rumors now? Wow, am I **really** that famous?"

Brighid showed him where the rumors came from, "Do you have any idea how much it costs to repair a _water tower?_ It's a lot."

Rex's eye sagged down, with Gramps commenting, "So, less famous, more- infamous."

Anyway, back to the point, Rex questioned, "Mòrag, is Mor Ardain **really** attacking?"

"They are. _As much as I **hate** to admit it._"

"**Tell me** -- what's going on?!"

After the story, Dromarch noted, "Tricky indeed. If this escalates into all-out war..."

Roderich agreed, "The timing is all wrong. **We can't** win this fight, **not** now..."

Zeke noted, "Sounds like you WERE planning to start this sooner or later. Sly rat."

Rex: "Maybe save the accusations for now."

Mythra took over, asked, "But the Empire never really wanted a war, did it?"

Only now did Roderich focused on her, noticed, "That Core Crystal! Don't tell me you're the-"

"**ANSWER me!**" She snapped. 

He was intimidated by the legends, stuttered, "_Y-y-y-you're right._"

Rex: "Mythra?"

She was thinking from another point of view, asked out loud, "Who stands to gain from an Ardainian-Urayan war?"

"Who gains... **You don't mean...**"

Nia concluded, "**Jin and Torna!**"

Poppi: "It very possible."

Gramps: "But- how?"

Tora: "Maybe- just coincidence after all...?"

"_Masterpon_." After all those discussion, you still don't understand the situation? Poppi sighed. 

Rex: "I wish I could believe that."

Roderich pleaded, "Inquisitor Mòrag, please. **You are** the only one who could put a stop to this!"

"It's a bit late for that, **don't you think?** _But_ I'm not going to sit back and watch. **Brighid!**"

"Right." And they walked out the room, decided to deal with it themselves. 

"Mòrag..."

"Rex, this is an imperial matter. We can't ask for your aid in this affair."

"Not if it's really a coincidence, like Tora said. **But**... if Torna are really involved, doesn't that make this **our** problem, too?"

"_But..._"

"Think of it as- _compensation_ for the water tower! How's that?"

Nia: "I knew you'd go there."

Zeke: "You're so noble it hurts."

She thought for a while, weighing the pros and cons of involving the Aegis in all these, decided finally, asked formally, "Very well. Can I ask you- to help me again?"

Rex: "**Yep! We're on the case!**"

Mythra: "Yes, of course." Senator Roderich had not the face to face them, looking aside with guilt all the time they were talking. 

"I'll accompany you." At the door stood Fan. 

"Fan?"

"What's happening in Temperantia right now... It's being led by a weaponized Titan, correct? My power doesn't only affect Blades. It also works against Titans. **I**- am- certain... I can be of assistance. **Besides**..."

"Besides?"

She thought for a while before mustering the courage to share, "I-I have the strangest feeling that... I'm somehow **meant** to be there."

Oh no... meeting with Jin? Mythra don't know what to say about it. "Fan la Norne, you..."

They were waiting for their ship being prepared at the port. Meanwhile, they gathered around in a circle, talking. Nia was notorious about, "Hey, remind me again why we're bringing this spanner?"

Zeke answered for himself, "Because this sounds like fun."

"We're not on holiday here."

"I've heard a lot about _these Torna people._"

Pandoria added, "They're the ones collecting Core Crystals, yeah?"

"And besides... **I can't pretend** this doesn't concern us, too. _Not when they're calling themselves... Torna..._"

Nia wondered what he'd got to do with Torna. Rex looked at her and Mythra, to see if they'd any idea what he's talking about. Why so serious? She urged, "Shellhead?"

---

The ship drifted slowly towards Temperantia; it was near now. A soldier reported, "Lady Morag, greetings. I have news from the front. Our Titan weapon has crossed the central border! It's advancing at about 40 titanpeds per hour!"

"Hmm. I want to get in front of it." she ordered. "Is there a suitable place to dock?"

He immediately replied, "There's a bay **fairly close by.** If you dock there you **should** be able to get to the cliffs above it."

"Understood. **Go.**"

"Yes, ma'am."

---

Temperantia was a battle scarred land, with nothing but black lands and black mountains behind its back, certainly soot from remnants of bombing. Or perhaps, it'd been born like this? There were many mountains on the back of the Titan, perhaps the Titan is a porcupine? These pieces of sharp rocks aggregated together, is Temperantia.
