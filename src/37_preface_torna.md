# Preface for Torna: The Golden Country

The last time one translate the DLC for Xenoblade 3, ouch, that's a pain in the arse. First, one tried to make the book 'complete' by adding a preface and a postscript, and that ended not well, because one had nothing to say, especially not when the story is short. Having to copy all the "Terms" is another pain in the arse. Sure, the current terms aren't complete, just equipped with _enough_ to get you started; and if you want to know more, you still have to read the main story, as one lazily omitted most of them; but to copy and paste terms from one to another is not ideal, because one want to keep it lean, only to those that're relevant. Yet, relevancy have a problem, because one may need to tweak the definitions to fit a different age, or one may need to omit some of them; ultimately, one was annoyed not by the work, but the requirement to sort through such menial stuffs. Therefore, that's what we now have here, incorporating Torna: The Golden Country into the same book as part of the main story. 

You already know my writing style, and that'll stay about equal (unless one read some book and decided to try out new writing style again). The bolds and italics and highlights that signifies speaking louder or softer or whatever is carried forward into the next short story. 

There's really not much thing to say otherwise. One hadn't watched the cutscenes in like 7 years, and one don't remember the storyline too well except for Jin and Lora being the main protagonist, joining by the others along, ending with the Aegis war and the fall of Torna -- all that you wanted to know about Jin's wondrous heart. But how that will unfold, one invite you to join one on the adventure to Torna, the Golden Country.
